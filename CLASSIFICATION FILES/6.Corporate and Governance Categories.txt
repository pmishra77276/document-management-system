Issuer’s operating agreement, dated as of March 9, 2021 (the “Operating Agreement”)

a notice five days prior to the Closing to all investors who have committed to
invest in the Offering through a subscription agreement granting them an
opportunity to cancel their commitment up to forty-eight (48) hours prior to the
Closing. This notice will also identify if the Issuer will continue to accept
commitments up to the Closing and Offering Deadline.
(e) The Offering may close in batches after the Offering Deadline as requirements are
met for any such batch of subscribers.
4. Payment for Securities. The Investor shall pay to the Issuer the Total Purchase Price at
the time of entering into this Subscription Agreement. Investor may pay the Total Purchase
Price by ACH, credit card, or wire transfer subject to limitations set forth in this agreement or
3
through the Portal’s technology. Payment shall be submitted to the Escrow Agent and held by

been furnished any offering literature other than the Offering Documents and has relied only on
the information contained therein.
(g) The Investor understands and accepts that the purchase of the Securities involves
various risks, including the risks outlined in the Offering Documents. The Investor represents
that it is able to bear any loss associated with an investment in the Securities.
(h) The Investor confirms that it is not relying on any communication (written or
oral) of the Issuer or any of its affiliates, as investment advice or as a recommendation to
purchase the Securities. It is understood that information and explanations related to the terms
and conditions of the Securities provided in the Offering Documents or otherwise by the Issuer
or any of its affiliates shall not be considered investment advice or a recommendation to
purchase the Securities, and that neither the Issuer nor any of its affiliates is acting or has acted
as an advisor to the Investor in deciding to invest in the Securities.
(i) The Investor is familiar with the business and financial condition and operations
of the Issuer, all as generally described in the Offering Documents. The Investor has had access
to such information concerning the Issuer and the Securities as it deems necessary to enable it to
make an informed investment decision concerning the purchase of the Securities.
(j) The Investor understands that each of the Investor's representations and warranties
contained in this Subscription Agreement will be deemed to have been reaffirmed and confirmed
as of the Closing, taking into account all information received by the Investor.
(k) The Investor acknowledges that the Issuer has the right in its sole and absolute
discretion to abandon the Offering at any time prior to the completion of the offering. This
Subscription Agreement shall thereafter have no force or effect and the Issuer shall cause the

interest thereon, to the Investor.
5
(l) The Investor understands that no federal or state agency has passed upon the
merits or risks of an investment in the Securities or made any finding or determination
concerning the fairness or advisability of this investment.
(m) The Investor represents that it is not relying on (and will not at any time rely on)
any communication (written or oral) of the Issuer, as investment advice or as a recommendation
to purchase the Securities, it being understood that information and explanations related to the
terms and conditions of the Securities and the other transaction documents that are described in
the Offering Documents shall not be considered investment advice or a recommendation to
purchase the Securities.
(n) The Investor confirms that the Issuer has not (A) given any guarantee or
representation as to the potential success, return, effect or benefit (either legal, regulatory, tax,
financial, accounting or otherwise) of an investment in the Securities or (B) made any
representation to the Investor regarding the legality of an investment in the Securities under
applicable legal investment or similar laws or regulations. In deciding to purchase the Securities,
the Investor is not relying on the advice or recommendations of the Issuer and the Investor has
made its own independent decision that the investment in the Securities is suitable and
appropriate for the Investor.
(o) The Investor has such knowledge, skill and experience in business, financial and
investment matters that the Investor is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an
investment in the Securities. With the assistance of the Investor's own professional advisors, to
the extent that the Investor has deemed appropriate, the Investor has made its own legal, tax,
accounting and financial evaluation of the merits and risks of an investment in the Securities and
the consequences of this Subscription Agreement. The Investor has considered the suitability of
the Securities as an investment in light of its own circumstances and financial condition and the
Investor is able to bear the risks associated with an investment in the Securities.

income, net worth and previous investments through other regulation crowdfunding offerings
over the proceeding twelve month period and is compliant with such limitations based on the
Total Purchase Price.
(q) The Investor is acquiring the Securities solely for the Investor’s own beneficial
account, for investment purposes, and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any
distribution of the Securities. The Investor understands that the Securities have not been
registered under the Securities Act or any State Securities Laws by reason of specific exemptions
under the provisions thereof which depend in part upon the investment intent of the Investor and
of the other representations made by the Investor in this Subscription Agreement. The Investor
understands that the Issuer is relying upon the representations and agreements contained in this
Subscription Agreement (and any supplemental information) for the purpose of determining
whether this transaction meets the requirements for such exemptions.
(r) The Investor understands that the Securities are “restricted securities” under
applicable federal securities laws and that the Securities Act and the rules of the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) provide in substance that the Investor may
6
dispose of the Securities only pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities
Act or an exemption therefrom, and the Investor understands that the Issuer has no obligation or
intention to register any of the Securities, or to take action so as to permit sales pursuant to the
Securities Act (including Rule 144 thereunder). Accordingly, the Investor understands that under
the Commission's rules, the Investor may dispose of the Securities principally only in “private
placements” which are exempt from registration under the Securities Act, in which event the
transferee will acquire “restricted securities” subject to the same limitations as in the hands of the
Investor. Consequently, the Investor understands that the Investor must bear the economic risks
of the investment in the Securities for an indefinite period of time.
(s) The Investor understands that the Securities may not be transferred by the
Investor for a period of one year unless any such transfer is made pursuant to the exemptions
found in the regulation crowdfunding statutes and rules.
(t) The Investor agrees: (A) that the Investor will not sell, assign, pledge, give,
transfer or otherwise dispose of the Securities or any interest therein, or make any offer or
attempt to do any of the foregoing, except pursuant to a registration of the Securities under the
Securities Act and all applicable State Securities Laws, or in a transaction which is exempt from
the registration provisions of the Securities Act and all applicable State Securities Laws; and (B)
that the Issuer and its affiliates shall not be required to give effect to any purported transfer of
such Securities except upon compliance with the foregoing restrictions and any restrictions set
forth in the Offering Documents.

to purchase and pay for the Securities specified on the signature page and of the Issuer to sell the
Securities are subject to the satisfaction at or prior to the Closing of the following conditions
precedent: the representations and warranties of the Issuer contained in Section 6 hereof and of

RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING
OUT OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS SUBSCRIPTION
AGREEMENT.

offers, purchases or sales of the Securities by the Investor (“Proceedings”), the Investor

18. Binding Effect. The provisions of this Subscription Agreement shall be binding upon and
accrue to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, legal representatives,

Agreement shall survive (i) the acceptance of the subscription by the Issuer and the Closing, (ii)

2
Business transacted at any special meeting of shareholders shall be limited to the purpose
stated in the notice.
Section 4. Notice of Meetings; Adjournments: Whenever shareholders are required or
permitted to take any action at a meeting, a notice of the meeting shall be given that shall state
the place, date and hour of the meeting and the record date for determining the shareholders
entitled to vote at the meeting (if such date is different from the record date for shareholders
entitled to notice of the meeting). Unless otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of
Incorporation of the corporation or these Bylaws, the notice of any meeting shall be given not
less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each
shareholder entitled to vote at the meeting as of the record date for determining the shareholders
entitled to notice of the meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be given when
deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the shareholder at such
shareholder's address as it appears on the records of the corporation.
In the case of an annual meeting, the notice of meeting need not specifically state the
business to be transacted thereat unless such a statement is expressly required by the provisions
of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
In the case of a special meeting, the notice of meeting shall specifically state the purpose
or purposes for which the meeting is called. In the case of a special meeting called by the written
request of a majority of the members of the Board of Directors, the notice also shall state that the
meeting is being called upon such written request.
Any meeting of shareholders, annual or special, may adjourn from time to time to
reconvene at the same or some other place. At the adjourned meeting the corporation may
transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. Notice need not
be given of any such adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the
meeting at which the adjournment is taken, provided (a) the adjournment is for less than thirty
(30) days, and (b) the record date for the meeting is not changed. If the adjournment is for more
than thirty (30) days, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each shareholder of
record entitled to vote at the meeting. If after the adjournment a new record date for
determination of shareholders entitled to vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting, the Board of
Directors shall fix as the record date for determining shareholders entitled to notice of such
adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of shareholders
entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and shall give notice of the adjourned meeting to each
shareholder of record as of the record date so fixed for notice of such adjourned meeting.
Section 5. Voting Lists: The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the
corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten days before every meeting of shareholders, a
complete list of the shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting (provided, however, if the record
date for determining the shareholders entitled to vote is less than ten (10) days before the date of
the meeting, the list shall reflect the shareholders entitled to vote as of the tenth day before the
meeting date), arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each shareholder and
the number of shares registered in the name of each shareholder. Such list shall be open to the
examination of any shareholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting at least ten (10) days
prior to the meeting (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the
information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of meeting or (ii)
during ordinary business hours at the principal place of business of the corporation. A list of
shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting shall be produced and kept at the time and place of
3
the meeting during the whole time thereof and may be examined by any shareholder who is
present. Except as otherwise provided by law, the stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to
who are the shareholders entitled to examine the list of shareholders required by this Section 5 or
to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of shareholders.
Section 6. Quorum: The holders of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding and
entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all
meetings of the shareholders for the transaction of business except as otherwise provided by the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or by the Certificate of Incorporation of the
corporation. If, however, such quorum shall not be present or represented at any meeting of the
shareholders, the shareholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy,
shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than
announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present or represented. At such adjourned
meeting, at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any business may be transacted
which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified.
The shareholders present at a duly organized meeting may continue to do business until
adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a
quorum.
Section 7. Proxies: Each shareholder entitled to vote at a meeting of shareholders or to
express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may vote in person or
may authorize another person or persons to act for him by proxy, but no such proxy shall be
voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period.
Section 8. Voting of Shares: Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of
Incorporation and subject to the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware, each shareholder shall at every meeting of shareholders be entitled to one vote for
each share of issued and outstanding capital stock held by such shareholder. If the Certificate of
Incorporation provides for more or less than one vote for any share on any matter, any reference
in these Bylaws to a majority or other proportion of stock shall refer to such majority or other
proportion of the votes of such stock.
When a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the holders of a majority of the
stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy shall decide any question
brought before such meeting, unless the question is one which by express provision of the
Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws, the rules or regulations of any stock exchange
applicable to the corporation, or applicable law or pursuant to any regulation applicable to the
corporation or its securities a different vote is required in which case such express provision shall
govern and control the decision of such question.
Voting on all matters except the election of directors shall be by voice vote or by a show
of hands unless the holders of a majority of the shares represented at the meeting shall, prior to
the voting on any matter, demand a ballot vote on that particular matter.
Section 9. Written Consent by Shareholders: Unless otherwise provided in the
Certificate of Incorporation, any action required to be taken at any annual or special meeting of
shareholders of the corporation, or any action which may be taken at any annual or special
meeting of such shareholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without
a vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of
4
outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to
authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were
present and voted, and shall be delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in
the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the corporation
having custody of the book in which minutes of proceedings of shareholders are recorded.
Delivery made to the corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered
mail, return receipt requested.. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a
meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those shareholders who have
not consented in writing and who, if the action had been taken at a meeting, would have been
entitled to notice of the meeting if the record date for notice of such meeting had been the date
that written consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take the action were delivered to
the corporation.
Section 10. Presiding Officer: The Chairman of the Board shall preside at all meetings
of shareholders. If the Chairman of the Board is absent or unable or unwilling to preside, the
succession order for the presiding officer for purposes of these Bylaws shall be: the Vice
Chairmen of the Board in order of seniority, the Chief Executive Officer (if a Chief Executive
Officer shall have been designated by the Board of Directors), the President, and the Secretary.
If neither the Chairman of the Board nor any of the other listed officers is present and able and
willing to preside, the shareholders may elect a chairman to preside over the meeting.
Section 11. Notice of Shareholder Business and Nominations:
(A) Annual Meetings of Shareholders.
(1) Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the
corporation and the proposal of business to be considered by the shareholders may be made at an
annual meeting of shareholders only (a) pursuant to the corporation’s notice of meeting (or any
supplement thereto), (b) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or a duly authorized
committee thereof, or (c) by any shareholder of the corporation who was a shareholder of record
of the corporation at the time the notice provided for in this Section 11(A) is delivered to the
Secretary of the corporation, who is entitled to vote at the meeting, and who complies with the
notice procedures set forth in this Section 11(A).
(2) For any nominations or other business to be properly brought before an
annual meeting by a shareholder pursuant to clause (c) of paragraph (A)(1) of this Section 11, the
shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the corporation
and any such proposed business must constitute a proper matter for shareholder action. To be
timely, a shareholder’s notice must be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive
offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on the 45th day, nor earlier than the
close of business on the 90th day, prior to the first anniversary of the date that proxy statements
were first mailed to the corporation's shareholders in conjunction with the preceding year’s
annual meeting (provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more
than thirty days before or more than seventy days after the anniversary date of the preceding
year's annual meeting, notice by the shareholder must be so delivered not earlier than the close of
business on the 120th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on
the later of the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or the 10th day following the day on which
public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the corporation). In no event
shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting
5
commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a shareholder’s notice
as described above.
Such shareholder’s notice shall set forth:
(a) as to each person whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for
election as a director, all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in
solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required to
be disclosed, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and Rule 14a-11 thereunder, and such notice shall be
accompanied by the written consent of each person whom the shareholder proposes to nominate
to being nominated and to serving as a director if elected;
(b) as to any other business that the shareholder proposes to bring
before the meeting: (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the
meeting, (ii) the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed
for consideration and, in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend the By-laws
of the corporation, the language of the proposed amendment), (iii) a statement of the
shareholder's reasons for desiring such business to be brought before the meeting, and (iv) any
material interest in such business of such shareholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose
behalf the proposal is made; and
(c) as to the shareholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if
any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (i) the name and address of such
shareholder, as they appear on the corporation’s books, and of such beneficial owner, (ii) the
class or series and number of shares of capital stock of the corporation which are owned
beneficially and of record by such shareholder and such beneficial owner, (iii) a description of
any agreement, arrangement or understanding with respect to the nomination or proposal
between or among such shareholder and/or such beneficial owner, any of their respective
affiliates or associates, and any others acting in concert with any of the foregoing, including, in
the case of a nomination, the nominee, (iv) a description of any agreement, arrangement or
understanding (including any derivative or short positions, profit interests, options, warrants,
convertible securities, stock appreciation or similar rights, hedging transactions, and borrowed or
loaned shares) that has been entered into as of the date of the shareholder’s notice by, or on
behalf of, such shareholder and such beneficial owners, whether or not such instrument or right
shall be subject to settlement in underlying shares of capital stock of the corporation, the effect
or intent of which is to mitigate loss to, manage risk or benefit of share price changes for, or
increase or decrease the voting power of, such shareholder or such beneficial owner, with respect
to securities of the corporation, (v) a representation that the shareholder is a holder of record of
stock of the corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by
proxy at the meeting to propose such business or nomination, (vi) a representation as to whether
the shareholder or the beneficial owner, if any, intends or is part of a group which intends (1) to
deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the
corporation’s outstanding capital stock required to approve or adopt the proposal or elect the
nominee, and/or (2) otherwise to solicit proxies or votes from shareholders in support of such
proposal or nomination, and (vii) any other information relating to such shareholder and
beneficial owner, if any, required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to
be made in connection with solicitations of proxies or votes for, as applicable, the proposal
and/or for the election of directors in an election contest pursuant to and in accordance with
Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
6
Following receipt of notice of a proposed nomination, the corporation may require the
shareholder or proposed nominee to provide such other information as may be reasonably
necessary to determine the nominee's eligibility to serve as a director of the corporation.
(3) The requirements of paragraph (A)(2) of this Section 11 shall be deemed
satisfied by a shareholder, with respect to business other than a nomination, if the shareholder
has notified the corporation of his, her, or its intention to present a proposal at an annual
meeting in compliance with Rule 14a-8 (or any successor thereof) promulgated under the
Exchange Act and such shareholder’s proposal has been included in a proxy statement that has
been prepared by the corporation to solicit proxies for such annual meeting.
(4) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph (A)(2) of this
Section 11 to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of
Directors at the annual meeting is increased effective after the time period for which notices of
nominations would otherwise be due under paragraph (A)(2) of this Section 11 and there is no
public announcement by the corporation naming the nominees for the additional directorships at
least 100 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year’s annual meeting, a
shareholder’s notice required by this Section 11(A) regarding the nomination of persons for
election as directors also shall be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for the
additional directorships, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices
of the corporation not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which
such public announcement is first made by the corporation.
(B) Special Meetings of Shareholders. Only such business shall be conducted at a
special meeting of shareholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the
corporation’s notice of meeting. If, as determined by the Board of Directors, the corporation's
notice of meeting indicates that directors shall be elected at a special meeting, nominations of
persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at that meeting (1) by or at the
direction of the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof or (2) by any
shareholder of the corporation who is a shareholder of record at the time the notice provided for
in this Section 11(B) is delivered to the Secretary of the corporation, who is entitled to vote at the
meeting and upon such election, and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this
Section 11(B). In the event the corporation calls a special meeting of shareholders for the
purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such shareholder entitled
to vote in such election of directors may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for
election to fill the directorships to be voted upon at the meeting, as specified in the corporation’s
notice of meeting, if a written notice in the form and containing the information required by
paragraph (A)(2) of this Section 11 shall be delivered by the shareholder to the Secretary at the
principal executive offices of the corporation not earlier than the close of business on the 120th
day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th
day prior to such special meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public
announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by
the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting. In no event shall the public announcement
of an adjournment or postponement of a special meeting commence a new time period (or extend
any time period) for the giving of a shareholder’s notice as described above.
(C) General.
(1) Except as otherwise expressly provided in any applicable rule or regulation
promulgated under the Exchange Act, only such persons who are nominated in accordance with
7
the procedures set forth in this Section 11 shall be eligible to be elected at an annual or special
meeting of shareholders of the corporation to serve as directors, and only such business shall be
considered, transacted or voted upon at a meeting of shareholders as shall have been brought
before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 11. Except as
otherwise provided by law, the presiding officer or chairman of the meeting (as determined as
provided in Section 10 of this Article II) shall have the power and duty (a) to determine whether
a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed,
as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 11 (including
whether the shareholder or beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal
is made solicited, or is part of a group which solicited, or did not so solicit, as the case may be,
proxies or votes in support of such shareholder’s nominee or proposal in compliance with such
shareholder's representation as required by clause (A)(2)(c)(iv) of this Section 11), and (b) if any
proposed nomination or business was not made or proposed in compliance with this Section 11,
to declare that such nomination shall be disregarded or that such proposed business shall not be
considered, transacted or voted upon. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section
11, unless otherwise required by law, if the shareholder (or a qualified representative of the
shareholder) does not appear at the annual or special meeting of shareholders of the corporation
to present a nomination or business, such nomination shall be disregarded and such proposed
business shall not be considered, transacted or voted upon, notwithstanding that a written notice
of such nomination or proposed business has been received by the corporation in accordance
with this Section 11 or that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the
corporation. For purposes of this Section 11, to be considered a qualified representative of the
shareholder, a person must be a duly authorized officer, manager or partner of such shareholder
or must be authorized by a writing executed by such shareholder or an electronic transmission
delivered by such shareholder to act for such shareholder as proxy at the meeting of shareholders
and such person must produce such writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction
of the writing or electronic transmission, at the meeting of shareholders.
(2) For purposes of this Section 11, and with respect to any annual or special
meeting of shareholders, "public announcement" shall include disclosure in a press release
reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or other national news service or in a
document (including without limitation a Current Report on Form 8-K) publicly filed by the
corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of
the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 11, a shareholder
shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 11;
provided however, that any references in these Bylaws to the Exchange Act or the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder are not intended to and shall not limit any requirements
applicable to nominations or proposals as to any other business to be considered pursuant to this
Section 11 (including paragraphs (A)(1)(c) and (B) hereof), and compliance with paragraphs
(A)(1)(c) and (B) of this Section 11 shall be the exclusive means for a shareholder to make
nominations or submit other business (other than, as provided in the first sentence of (A)(3),
business other than nominations brought properly under and in compliance with Rule 14a-8 of
the Exchange Act, as it may be amended from time to time). Nothing in this Section 11 shall be
deemed to affect any rights of shareholders (a) to request inclusion of proposals in the
corporation’s proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act, or (b) of the
holders of any series of preferred stock that may be issued from time to time to elect directors
pursuant to any applicable provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation.
8
Section 12. Conduct of Meetings: The time of the opening and the closing of the polls
for each matter upon which the shareholders will vote at an annual or special meeting of
shareholders shall be announced at the meeting by the presiding officer or chairman of the
meeting. The Board of Directors may adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for the
conduct of a meeting of shareholders, or of meetings of shareholders in general, as it shall deem
appropriate. Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations as are adopted by
the Board of Directors, the presiding officer or chairman of any meeting of shareholders shall
have the right and authority to convene and for any or no reason to adjourn and/or recess the
meeting and to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures, and take all such other actions,
as in his or her judgment are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules,
regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board of Directors or prescribed by the
presiding officer or chairman of the meeting, may include, without limitation: (i) the
establishment of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (ii) rules and procedures for
maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (iii) limitations on attendance at
or participation in the meeting to shareholders of record of the corporation, their duly authorized
and constituted proxies, or such other persons as the chairman of the meeting shall determine;
(iv) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; and
(v) limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants. The presiding
officer or chairman at any meeting of shareholders, in addition to making any other
determinations that may be appropriate to the conduct of the meeting, shall, if the facts warrant,
determine and declare to the meeting that a matter or business (including without limitation the
nomination of a person for election as a director) was not properly brought before or made at the
meeting and if such presiding officer or chairman should so determine, he or she shall so declare
to the meeting and any such matter or business (including any nomination) not properly brought
before or made at the meeting shall not be considered, transacted or voted upon. Unless and to
the extent determined by the Board of Directors or the presiding officer or chairman of the
meeting, meetings of shareholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with the rules of
parliamentary procedure.
ARTICLE III
Directors
Section 1. General Powers: The business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed
by or under the direction of the Board of Directors. The directors shall have and exercise full
power in the management and conduct of the business and affairs of the corporation and do all
such lawful acts and things as are not by statute, or by Certificate of Incorporation, directed or
required to be exercised or done by the shareholders.
Section 2. Number, Term, and Qualifications: The number of directors of the
corporation shall be not less than five nor more than thirty. The Board of Directors shall
determine the exact number of directors which shall be not less than five nor more than thirty
without a Bylaw modification. Subject to any limitations on service prescribed by the Board of
Directors, each director shall hold office until his death, resignation, retirement, removal,
disqualification, or until his successor is elected and qualified. Directors need not be residents of
the State of Delaware ; provided, however, that not less than three-fourths (3/4) of the directors
shall be citizens of the United States of America. To be eligible for election and continued
service as a director, a person must own at least 100 shares of the common stock of the
corporation, individually in his or her own name, jointly with his or her spouse, or in an account
for his or her direct benefit. The Board of Directors, or any committee authorized by the Board,
9
shall determine whether any particular form of ownership will be recognized as satisfying the
share ownership requirements of these Bylaws.
Section 3. Election of Directors: Except as provided in Section 5 of this Article, the
directors shall be elected by written ballot at the annual meeting of the shareholders and those
persons who receive the highest number of votes shall be deemed to have been elected.
Section 4. Removal: Any director may be removed from office, with or without cause,
by a vote of shareholders holding a majority of the shares entitled to vote at an election of
directors. If any directors are so removed, new directors may be elected at the same meeting.
Section 5. Vacancies: Vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any
increase in the authorized number of directors may be filled by a majority vote of the directors
then in office, though less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, and the directors so
chosen shall hold office until the next annual election and until their successors are duly elected
and shall qualify, unless sooner displaced. If there are no directors in office, then an election of
directors may be held in the manner provided by statute. If, at the time of filling any vacancy or
any newly created directorship, the directors then in office shall constitute less than a majority of
the whole Board (as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), the Court of Chancery
may, upon application of any shareholder or shareholders owning at least ten percent of the total
number of the shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote for such directors,
summarily order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies or newly created directorships,
or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in office.
Section 6. Chairman and Vice Chairmen of the Board: The Board of Directors shall
from time to time elect from among its members a Chairman of the Board and may elect from
among its members such Vice Chairmen as it may deem advisable. The Chairman of the Board
shall preside at all meetings of the Board of Directors. If the Chairman of the Board is absent or
unable or unwilling to preside, the succession order for the presiding officer for purposes of these
Bylaws shall be the Vice Chairmen of the Board in order of seniority; the Chief Executive
Officer, if not the Chairman of the Board and if a member of the Board of Directors; and the
President, if a member of the Board of Directors. If neither the Chairman of the Board nor any
of the other listed officers is present and able and willing to preside, the directors present may
elect a chairman to preside over the meeting.
Section 7. Compensation: The Board of Directors may compensate directors for their
services as such and may provide for the payment of all expenses incurred by directors in
attending regular and special meetings of the Board. Members of special or standing committees
of the Board of Directors may be allowed like compensation and expenses for their committee
services.
Section 8. Committees of the Board: The Board of Directors may designate one or more
committees of the Board, each committee to consist of two or more directors of the corporation.
The corporation elects to be governed by Section 141(c)(2) of the General Corporation law of the
State of Delaware. The Board may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any
committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the
committee. In the absence or disqualification of any member of such committee or committees,
the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting,
whether or not he or they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the
Board of Directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member.
10
Any such committee, to the extent provided in these Bylaws and in the resolution creating and
delegating authorities to the committee, shall have and may exercise the powers of the Board of
Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the corporation and may authorize the
seal of the corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it, except as limited by the
provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. Such committee or
committees shall have such name or names as may be determined from time to time by
resolution adopted by the Board of Directors or as set forth in these Bylaws. Each committee
shall keep regular minutes of its meetings and report the same to the Board of Directors when
required.
ARTICLE IV
Meetings of Directors
Section 1. Regular Meetings: A regular meeting of the Board of Directors shall be held
immediately after, and at the same place as, the annual meeting of shareholders. In addition, the
Board of Directors may provide, by resolution, the time and place, either within or without the
State of Delaware, for the holding of additional regular meetings, one of which shall be held in
each calendar quarter.
Section 2. Special Meetings: Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called
by or at the request of the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive
Officer (if a Chief Executive Officer shall have been designated by the Board of Directors), the
President, or any two directors. Such meetings may be held either within or without the State of
Delaware.
Section 3. Notice of Meetings: Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held

The person or persons calling a special meeting of the Board of Directors shall, at least
one day before the meeting, give each director written notice, notice by electronic transmission,

notice need not specify the purpose for which the meeting is called, unless a statement of the
specific purpose is otherwise required by these Bylaws. Unless otherwise indicated in the notice,
any and all business may be transacted at the special meeting.
Section 4. Quorum: A majority of the duly elected and qualified members of the Board
of Directors (but in any event not fewer than one-third of the total number of directors as
established by these Bylaws and fixed by the Board of Directors) shall constitute a quorum for
the transaction of business at any meeting of the Board of Directors.
Section 5. Manner of Acting: Except as otherwise provided in these Bylaws, or as
specifically provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation, the act of the majority of
the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board of
Directors. If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the Board of Directors, the

Stock and Stock Transfer
Section 1. Certificates of Stock: Stock of the corporation may be issued, registered and
held with or without certificates to represent such stock. The Board of Directors by resolution or
resolutions may provide that some or all of any or all classes or series of stock shall be
uncertificated shares. If stock is represented by certificates, the certificates shall be issued in
such form as the Board of Directors shall determine. Such stock certificates shall indicate
thereon a reference to any and all restrictive conditions of said stock. These certificates shall be
signed by the Chairman of the Board, or a Vice Chairman of the Board, or the President, or any
Vice President and the Secretary, an Assistant Secretary, Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer, or
may have facsimile signatures of such officers placed thereon and such officers shall have the
power to make or order to be made by an authorized officer or transfer agent any and all transfers
of the securities of the corporation. Stock certificates shall be consecutively numbered or
otherwise identified; and the name and address of the persons to whom they are issued, with the
number of shares and the date of issue, shall be entered on the stock transfer books of the
corporation. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile
signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or
registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same
effect as if he were such an officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue. Where stock is
not represented by certificates, the name and address of the persons to whom they are registered,
with the number of shares and the date of registration, shall be entered on the stock transfer
books of the corporation; and within a reasonable time after the registration of such stock, the
corporation shall send the shareholder to whom such stock has been registered a written
statement of the information otherwise required by law to be on a certificate evidencing those
shares.
16
Section 2. Transfer of Stock: Transfers of stock shall be made on the stock transfer
books of the corporation upon surrender of the certificates for the shares sought to be transferred
by the registered holder thereof or by his duly authorized agent, transferee or legal representative
or, in the case of uncertificated shares, upon the written request of such persons in such form and
with such documentation as the Board may establish. All certificates surrendered for transfer
shall be cancelled before new certificates for the transferred shares shall be issued, or before any
shares shall be registered to the current or a subsequent holder without certificate. Upon
surrender to the corporation or its transfer agent of a certificate for shares, or in the case of an
uncertificated share upon delivery of written request together with any required information or
documentation, which is duly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of succession,
assignment or authority to transfer, it shall be the duty of the corporation or its transfer agent to
issue a new certificate or, upon appropriate request, to register uncertificated shares to the person
entitled thereto, to cancel any old certificate and to record the transaction upon its books. The
corporation shall maintain, or cause one or more stock transfer agents to maintain, stock transfer
records containing the name and address of each shareholder of record and the number of shares
and class or series of stock held by each such shareholder.
Section 3. Fixing Record Date:
(a) In order that the corporation may determine the shareholders entitled to notice of
any meeting of shareholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board of Directors may fix a record
date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record
date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall, unless otherwise required
by law, not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting.
If the Board of Directors so fixes a date, such date shall also be the record date for determining
the shareholders entitled to vote at such meeting unless the Board of Directors determines, at the
time it fixes such record date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the
date for making such determination. If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the
record date for determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of
shareholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice
is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on
which the meeting is held. A determination of shareholders of record entitled to notice of or to
vote at a meeting of shareholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided,
however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for determination of shareholders
entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and in such case shall also fix as the record date for
shareholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed
for determination of shareholders entitled to vote in accordance with the foregoing provisions of
this subsection (a) at the adjourned meeting.
(b) In order that the corporation may determine the shareholders entitled to receive
payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise
any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any
other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not
precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which shall not
be more than sixty (60) days prior to such action. If no such record date is fixed, the record date
for determining shareholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on
which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.
(c) Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation, in order that the
corporation may determine the shareholders entitled to express consent to corporate action in
17
writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall
not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of
Directors, and which record date shall not be more than ten (10) days after the date upon which
the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. If no record date for
determining shareholders entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a
meeting is fixed by the Board of Directors, (i) when no prior action of the Board of Directors is
required by law, the record date for such purpose shall be the first date on which a signed written
consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the corporation in
accordance with applicable law, and (ii) if prior action by the Board of Directors is required by
law, the record date for such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the
Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
Section 4. Lost Certificates: The Board of Directors may authorize and direct the
issuance of a new certificate of stock or uncertificated shares in place of any certificate
theretofore issued by it, alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, and the Board of Directors
in its discretion may require the owner of the lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or such owner's
legal representative, to give the corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify it against any claim
that may be made against it on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such
certificate or the issuance of such new certificate or uncertificated shares.
Section 5. Registered Shareholders: The corporation shall be entitled to recognize the
exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the owner of shares to receive dividends,
and to vote as such owner, and to hold liable for calls and assessments a person registered on its
books as the owner of shares, and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to
interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have
express or other notice hereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of Delaware.
Section 6. Treasury Shares: Treasury shares of the corporation shall consist of such
shares as have been issued and thereafter acquired but not retired by the corporation.

Section 4. Notice and Waiver of Notice: Whenever any notice is required to be given to
any shareholder or director under the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware or under the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of this
corporation, it shall not be construed to mean personal notice, but such notice may be given in
writing, by mail, addressed to such director or shareholder, at his address as it appears on the
records of the corporation, with postage thereon prepaid, and such notice shall be deemed to be
given at the time when the same shall be deposited in the United States mail. Notice to directors,
and to shareholders to the extent and in the manner permitted by applicable law, may also be
given by telegram, telephone, telecopier or other electronic transmission.
Whenever notice is required to be given under the provisions of the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware or of the Certificate of Incorporation or of these Bylaws, a waiver
thereof in writing or by electronic transmission, signed or given by the person or persons entitled
to such notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent thereto.
The attendance by a director at a meeting of the Board or a committee of the Board shall
constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where a director attends a meeting for the
express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business
because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.
The attendance by a shareholder at a meeting of shareholders shall constitute a waiver of
notice of such meeting, except where a shareholder attends a meeting for the express purpose of
objecting at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting
is not lawfully called or convened.
Section 5. Amendments: Except as otherwise provided herein, these Bylaws may be
altered, amended or repealed and new bylaws may be adopted at any regular meeting of the
Board of Directors or the shareholders, or at any special meeting of the Board of Directors or
shareholders if notice of such alteration, amendment, repeal or adoption, be contained in the
notice of said special meeting.
Section 6. Fiscal Year: The fiscal year of the corporation shall be fixed by the Board of
Directors.

(a) Right to Indemnification. The corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law as it presently exists or may hereafter be amended, any
person (a “Covered Person”) who was or is made or is threatened to be made a party or is
otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (a “proceeding”), by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person for whom he or
she is the legal representative, is or was a director, officer, or employee of the corporation or,
while a director, officer, or employee of the corporation, is or was serving at the request of the
corporation as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation or of a partnership,
joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with respect to employee
benefit plans, against all liability and loss suffered and expenses (including attorneys’ fees,
judgments, fines, taxes, including ERISA excise taxes, or penalties, and amounts paid in
settlement) reasonably incurred by such Covered Person, and such indemnification shall continue
as to a Covered Person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee, or agent and inure to
19
the benefit or his or her heirs, executors, and administrators. Notwithstanding the preceding
sentence, except as otherwise provided in Section 7(c), the corporation shall be required to
indemnify a Covered Person in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) commenced by
such Covered Person only if the commencement of such proceeding (or part thereof) by the
Covered Person was authorized in the specific case by the Board of Directors of the corporation.
(b) Advancement of Expenses. The corporation shall to the fullest extent not prohibited
by applicable law pay the expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by a Covered Person in
defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition, provided, however, that, to the
extent required by law, such payment of expenses in advance of the final disposition of the
proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by the Covered Person to repay all
amounts advanced if it should be ultimately determined that the Covered Person is not entitled to
be indemnified under this Section 7 or otherwise.
(c) Claims. If a claim for indemnification under this Section 7 (following the final
disposition of such proceeding) is not paid in full within sixty days after the corporation has
received a claim therefor by the Covered Person, or, subject to subsection 7(b), if a claim for any
advancement of expenses under this Section 7 is not paid in full within thirty days after the
corporation has received a statement or statements requesting such amounts to be advanced, the
Covered Person shall thereupon (but not before) be entitled to file suit to recover the unpaid
amount of such claim. If successful in whole or in part, the Covered Person shall be entitled to
be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim to the fullest extent permitted by law. In any such
action, the corporation shall have the burden of proving that the Covered Person is not entitled to
the requested indemnification or advancement of expenses under applicable law.
(d) Non-exclusivity of Rights. The rights conferred on any Covered Person by this
Section 7 shall not be exclusive of any other rights which such Covered Person may have or
hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the certificate of incorporation, these bylaws,
agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.
(e) Other Sources. The corporation’s obligation, if any, to indemnify or to advance
expenses to any Covered Person who was or is serving at its request as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit
entity shall be reduced by any amount such Covered Person may collect as indemnification or
advancement of expenses from such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise
or non-profit enterprise.
(f) Amendment or Repeal. Any right to indemnification or to advancement of expenses
of any Covered Person arising hereunder shall not be eliminated or impaired by an amendment to
or repeal of these bylaws after the occurrence of the act or omission that is the subject of the
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding for which
indemnification or advancement of expenses is sought.
(g) Other Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses. This Section 7 shall not limit
the right of the corporation, to the extent and in the manner permitted by law, to indemnify and
to advance expenses to persons other than Covered Persons when and as authorized by
appropriate corporate action.
Section 8. Exclusive Forum for Certain Disputes: Unless the corporation consents in
writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
or, if such court lacks jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware, shall, to
20
the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (1) any derivative action
or proceeding brought on behalf of the corporation, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of
a duty owed by any director, officer, other employee or shareholder of the corporation to the
corporation or the corporation's shareholders, (3) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to
any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or as to which the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware, and (4) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs
doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in
shares of capital stock of the corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the
provisions of this Section 8.

Stock with respect to which any person holds an Option shall be considered to be owned by such person. Ownership of LTIP Units shall be treated as ownership of shares of Common Stock on a 1-for-1 basis.

6. Stock. Subject to adjustments pursuant to Section 16, Grants with respect to an aggregate of no more than 1,263,580 Shares may be granted under the Plan (all of which may be issued as Options). Subject to adjustments pursuant to Section 16, in the case of Grants intended to qualify for relief from the limitations of Section 162(m) of the Code, (i) the maximum number of Shares with respect to which any Options may be granted in any one year to any Grantee shall not exceed 150,000, and (ii) the maximum number of Shares that may underlie Grants, other than Grants of Options, in any one year to any Grantee shall not exceed 150,000. Notwithstanding the first sentence of this Section 6, (i) Shares that have been granted as Restricted Stock or that have been reserved for distribution in payment for Options, Restricted Stock Units or Phantom Shares but are later forfeited or for any other reason are not payable under the Plan; and (ii) Shares as to which an Option is granted under the Plan that remains unexercised at the expiration, forfeiture or other termination of such Option, may be the subject of the issue of further Grants. Shares of Common Stock issued hereunder may consist, in whole or in part, of authorized and unissued shares, or treasury shares. The certificates for Shares issued hereunder may include any legend which the Committee deems appropriate to reflect any restrictions on transfer hereunder or under the Agreement, or as the Committee may otherwise deem appropriate. For the avoidance of doubt, Shares subject to DERs shall be subject to the limitation of this Section 6. Notwithstanding the limitations above in this Section 6, except in the case of Grants intended to qualify for relief from the limitations of Section 162(m) of the Code, there shall be no limit on the number of Phantom Shares or DERs to the extent they are paid out in cash that may be granted under the Plan. If any Phantom Shares or DERs are paid out in cash, the underlying Shares may again be made the subject of Grants under the Plan, notwithstanding the first sentence of this Section 6. A Grant of LTIP Units under Section 13 hereof shall be treated for purposes of the limits in this Section 6 as a Grant covering Shares on a 1 Share for 1 LTIP Unit basis.

7. Terms and Conditions of Options.

(a) Exercise Price. Each Agreement with an Eligible Person shall state the Exercise Price. The Exercise Price for any Option shall not be less than the Fair Market Value on the date of Grant.

(b) Medium and Time of Payment. Except as may otherwise be provided below, the Purchase Price for each Option granted to an Eligible Person shall be payable in full in United States dollars upon the exercise of the Option. In the event the Company determines that it is required to withhold taxes as a result of the exercise of an Option, as a condition to the exercise thereof, an Employee may be required to make arrangements satisfactory to the Company to enable it to satisfy such withholding requirements in accordance with Section 21. If the applicable Agreement so provides, or the Committee otherwise so permits, the Purchase Price may be paid in one or a combination of the following:

(i) by a certified or bank cashier’s check;

(ii) by the surrender of Shares in good form for transfer, owned by the person exercising the Option and having a Fair Market Value on the date of exercise equal to the Purchase Price, or in any combination of cash and Shares, as long as the sum of the cash so paid and the Fair Market Value of the Shares so surrendered equals the Purchase Price and provided that accepting such Shares will not result in any adverse accounting consequences to the Company as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion;

(iii) by cancellation of indebtedness owed by the Company to the Grantee;

(iv) subject to Section 18(e), by a loan or extension of credit from the Company evidenced by a full recourse promissory note executed by the Grantee. The interest rate and other terms and conditions of such note shall be determined by the Committee (in which case the Committee may require that the Grantee pledge his or her Shares to the Company for the purpose of securing the payment of such note, and in no event shall the certificate(s) representing such Shares be released to the Grantee until such note shall have been paid in full); or

(v) by any combination of such methods of payment or any other method acceptable to the Committee in its discretion.

Except in the case of Options exercised by certified or bank cashier’s check, the Committee may impose such limitations and prohibitions on the exercise of Options as it deems appropriate, including, without limitation, any limitation or prohibition designed to avoid accounting consequences which may result from the use of Common Stock as payment upon exercise of an Option. Any fractional shares of Common Stock resulting from a Grantee’s election that are accepted by the Company shall in the discretion of the Committee be paid in cash.

 

7

(c) Term and Nontransferability of Grants and Options.

(i) Each Agreement reflecting the Grant of an Option shall state the time or times which all or part of the Option becomes exercisable, subject to the restrictions set forth in this subsection (c).

(ii) No Option shall be exercisable except by the Grantee or a transferee permitted hereunder.

(iii) No Option shall be assignable or transferable, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution of the state wherein the Grantee is domiciled at the time of his death; provided, however, that the Committee may (but need not) permit other transfers, where the Committee concludes that such transferability is otherwise appropriate and desirable.

(iv) No Option shall be exercisable until such time as set forth in the applicable Agreement (but in no event after the expiration of such Grant).

(v) No Option may be exercised more than 10 years after the date the Option was granted.

(vi) No modification of an Option shall, without the consent of the Optionee, alter or impair any rights or obligations under any Option previously granted.

(d) Termination of Service, Other Than by Death or Disability. Unless otherwise provided in the applicable Agreement, upon any Termination of Service for any reason other than his or her death or Disability, an Optionee shall have the right, subject to the restrictions of Section 4(c) above, to exercise his or her Option at any time within three months after Termination of Service, but only to the extent that, at the date of Termination of Service, the Optionee’s right to exercise such Option had vested pursuant to the terms of the applicable Agreement and had not previously been exercised; provided, however, that, unless otherwise provided in the applicable Agreement, if there occurs a Termination of Service by a Participating Company for Cause, any Option not exercised in full prior to such termination shall be canceled.

(e) Death of Optionee. Unless otherwise provided in the applicable Agreement, if an Optionee dies while an Eligible Person and has not fully exercised the Option, then the Option may be exercised in full, subject to the restrictions of Section 4(c) above, at any time within 12 months after the Optionee’s death, by the Successor of the Optionee, but only to the extent that, at the date of death, the Optionee’s right to exercise such Option had vested and had not been forfeited pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and had not previously been exercised.

(f) Disability of Optionee. Unless otherwise provided in the Agreement, upon any Termination of Service for reason of his or her Disability, an Optionee shall have the right, subject to the restrictions of Section 4(c) above, to exercise the Option at any time within 12 months after Termination of Service, but only to the extent that, at the date of Termination of Service, the Optionee’s right to exercise such Option had accrued pursuant to the terms of the applicable Agreement and had not previously been exercised.

 

8

(g) Rights as an Owner. An Optionee, a Successor of the Optionee, or the holder of a DER shall have no rights as the owner of the Shares covered thereby (including rights as a stockholder, if applicable) until, in the case of an Optionee, the date of the issuance of a certificate for such Shares. No adjustment shall be made for dividends (ordinary or extraordinary, whether in cash, securities or other property), distributions or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date such certificate is issued, except as provided in Section 16.

(h) Stock Appreciation Rights. The Committee, in its discretion, may (taking into account, without limitation, the application of Section 409A of the Code, as the Committee may deem appropriate) also permit the Optionee to elect to exercise an Option by receiving Shares, cash or a combination thereof, in the discretion of the Committee, with an aggregate Fair Market Value (or, to the extent of payment in cash, in an amount) equal to the excess of the Fair Market Value of the Shares with respect to which the Option is being exercised over the aggregate Purchase Price, as determined as of the day the Option is exercised.

(i) Deferral. The Committee may establish a program (taking into account, without limitation, the application of Section 409A of the Code, as the Committee may deem appropriate) under which Optionees will have Phantom Shares subject to Section 10 credited upon their exercise of Options, rather than receiving Shares at that time.

(j) Other Provisions. The Agreement authorized under the Plan may contain such other provisions not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan (including, without limitation, restrictions upon the exercise of the Option) as the Committee shall deem advisable. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, in no event may the Company provide any payment, cash or otherwise, to cancel or replace an Option with an Exercise Price greater than then Fair Market Value without first obtaining stockholder approval.

8. Special Rules for Incentive Stock Options.

(a) Each Option will be designated in the Award Agreement as either an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonqualified Stock Option. However, notwithstanding such designation, to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Shares with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by the Participant during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company and any parent corporation or Subsidiary) exceeds one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), such Options will be treated as Nonqualified Stock Options. For purposes of this Section 8(a), Incentive Stock Options will be taken into account in the order in which they were granted. The Fair Market Value of the Shares will be determined as of the time the Option with respect to such Shares is granted.

(b) In the case of an individual described in Section 422(b)(6) of the Code (relating to certain 10% owners), the Exercise Price with respect to an Incentive Stock Option shall not be less than 110% of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the day the Option is granted and the term of an Incentive Stock Option shall be no more than five years from the date of grant.

 

9

(c) If Shares acquired upon exercise of an Incentive Stock Option are disposed of in a disqualifying disposition within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, such Optionee shall notify the Company in writing as soon as practicable thereafter of the date and terms of such disposition and, if the Company thereupon has a tax-withholding obligation, shall pay to the Company an amount equal to any withholding tax the Company is required to pay as a result of the disqualifying disposition.

9. Provisions applicable to Restricted Stock.

(a) Vesting Periods. In connection with the grant of Restricted Stock, whether or not Performance Goals apply thereto, the Committee shall establish one or more vesting periods with respect to the shares of Restricted Stock granted, the length of which shall be determined in the discretion of the Committee. Subject to the provisions of this Section 9, the applicable Agreement and the other provisions of the Plan, restrictions on Restricted Stock shall lapse if the Grantee satisfies all applicable employment or other service requirements through the end of the applicable vesting period.

(b) Grant of Restricted Stock. Subject to the other terms of the Plan, the Committee may, in its discretion as reflected by the terms of the applicable Agreement: (i) authorize the granting of Restricted Stock to Eligible Persons; (ii) provide a specified purchase price for the Restricted Stock (whether or not the payment of a purchase price is required by any state law applicable to the Company); (iii) determine the restrictions applicable to Restricted Stock and (iv) determine or impose other conditions to the grant of Restricted Stock under the Plan as it may deem appropriate. As a condition to the Grant of Restricted Stock, the Grantee must agree to not file, with respect to such Grant, an election to recognize income under Section 83(b) of the Code without the permission of the Company.

(c) Certificates.

(i) Each Grantee of Restricted Stock shall be issued a certificate in respect of Shares of Restricted Stock awarded under the Plan. Such certificate shall be registered in the name of the Grantee. Without limiting the generality of Section 6, in addition to any legend that might otherwise be required by the Board or the Company’s charter, bylaws or other applicable documents, the certificates for Shares of Restricted Stock issued hereunder may include any legend which the Committee deems appropriate to reflect any restrictions on transfer hereunder or under the applicable Agreement, or as the Committee may otherwise deem appropriate, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, shall bear a legend referring to the terms, conditions, and restrictions applicable to such Grant, substantially in the following form:

THE TRANSFERABILITY OF THIS CERTIFICATE AND THE SHARES REPRESENTED HEREBY ARE SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS (INCLUDING FORFEITURE) OF THE CITY OFFICE REIT, INC. EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN, AND AN AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO BETWEEN THE REGISTERED OWNER AND CITY OFFICE REIT, INC. COPIES OF SUCH PLAN AND AWARD AGREEMENT ARE ON FILE IN THE OFFICES OF CITY OFFICE REIT, INC. AT 1075 WEST GEORGIA STREET, SUITE 2600, VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA, V6E 3C9.

 

10

(ii) The Committee shall require that the certificates evidencing such Shares be held in custody by the Company until the restrictions hereunder shall have lapsed and that, as a condition of any grant of Restricted Stock, the Grantee shall have delivered a stock power, endorsed in blank, relating to the stock covered by such Grant. If and when such restrictions so lapse, the certificates shall be delivered by the Company to the Grantee or his or her designee as provided in Section 9(d).

(d) Restrictions and Conditions. Unless otherwise provided by the Committee in an Agreement, the Shares of Restricted Stock awarded pursuant to the Plan shall be subject to the following restrictions and conditions:

(i) Subject to the provisions of the Plan and the applicable Agreement, during a period commencing with the date of such Grant and ending on the date the period of forfeiture with respect to such Shares lapses, the Grantee shall not be permitted voluntarily or involuntarily to sell, transfer, pledge, anticipate, alienate, encumber or assign Shares of Restricted Stock awarded under the Plan (or have such Shares attached or garnished). Subject to the provisions of the applicable Agreement and clauses (iii) and (iv) below, the period of forfeiture with respect to Shares granted hereunder shall lapse as provided in the applicable Agreement.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless otherwise expressly provided by the Committee, the period of forfeiture with respect to such Shares shall only lapse as to whole Shares.

(ii) Except as provided in the foregoing clause (i) or in Section 16, the Grantee shall have, in respect of the Shares of Restricted Stock, all of the rights as an owner of such Shares, including the right to vote the Shares if applicable and, as provided in the applicable Agreement, to receive dividends; provided, however, that if the Shares of Restricted Stock will not vest solely on account of continued employment or service, cash dividends on such Shares shall be held by the Company (unsegregated as a part of its general assets) until the period of forfeiture lapses (and forfeited if the underlying Shares are forfeited), and paid over to the Grantee as soon as practicable after such period lapses (if not forfeited) to the extent that the underlying Shares vest. Certificates for Shares (not subject to restrictions hereunder) shall be delivered to the Grantee or his or her designee (or where permitted, transferee) promptly after, and only after, the period of forfeiture shall lapse without forfeiture in respect of such Shares of Restricted Stock.

(iii) Termination of Service. Unless otherwise provided in the applicable Agreement, and subject to clause (iv) below, if the Grantee has a Termination of Service, during the applicable period of forfeiture, then (A) all Restricted Stock still subject to restriction shall thereupon, and with no further action, be forfeited by the Grantee, along with any dividends or other amounts paid with respect to those Shares of Restricted Stock and (B) the Company shall pay to the Grantee as soon as practicable (and in no event more than 30 days) after such termination an amount equal to the lesser of (x) the amount paid by the Grantee for such forfeited Restricted Stock as contemplated by Section 9(b), and (y) the Fair Market Value on the date of termination of the forfeited Restricted Stock.

 

11

10. Provisions applicable to Restricted Stock Units.

(a) Vesting.

(i) In connection with the grant of Restricted Stock Units, whether or not Performance Goals apply thereto, the Committee shall establish one or more vesting periods with respect to the Restricted Stock Units, the length of which shall be determined in the discretion of the Committee.

(ii) Subject to the provisions of this Section 10, the applicable Agreement and the other provisions of the Plan, Restricted Stock Units shall vest as provided in the applicable Agreement.

(b) Termination of Service. Unless otherwise provided by the Committee in the applicable Agreement, if the Grantee has a Termination of Service, all of the Grantee’s unvested Restricted Stock Units, and any dividends or other amounts paid with respect to those unvested Restricted Stock Units, shall thereupon, and with no further action, be forfeited by the Grantee and cease to be outstanding, and no payments shall be made with respect to such forfeited Restricted Stock Units.

(c) Earning Restricted Stock Units. Upon meeting the applicable vesting criteria, the Grantee will be entitled to receive a payout as determined by the Committee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time after the grant of Restricted Stock Units, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may reduce or waive any vesting criteria that must be met to receive a payout.

(d) Form and Timing of Payment. Payment of earned Restricted Stock Units will be made upon the date(s) determined by the Committee and set forth in the applicable Agreement. The Committee, in its sole discretion, may only settled earned Restricted Stock Units in cash, Shares or a combination of both.

(e) Cancellation. On the date set forth in the applicable Agreement, all unearned Restricted Stock Units will be forfeited to the Company.

(f) Other Restricted Stock Unit Provisions.

(i) The Committee may establish a program (taking into account, without limitation, the possible application of Section 409A of the Code, as the Committee may deem appropriate) under which settlement of Restricted Stock Units may be deferred for periods in addition to those otherwise contemplated by the foregoing provisions of this Section 10.

(ii) Rights to payments with respect to Restricted Stock Units granted under the Plan shall not be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, attachment, garnishment, levy, execution, or other legal or equitable process, either voluntary or involuntary; and any attempt to anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber, attach or garnish, or levy or execute on any right to payments or other benefits payable hereunder, shall be void.

 

12

11. Provisions applicable to Phantom Shares.

(a) Term. The Committee may provide in an Agreement that any particular Phantom Share shall expire at the end of a specified term.

(b) Vesting. Subject to Section 11(c), Phantom Shares shall vest as provided in the applicable Agreement.

(c) Termination of Service. Unless otherwise provided in the applicable Agreement, if the Grantee has a Termination of Service, all of the Grantee’s unvested Phantom Shares, and any dividends, or other amounts paid with respect to more unvested Phantom Shares, shall thereupon, and with no further action, be forfeited by the Grantee and cease to be outstanding, and no payments shall be made with respect to such forfeited Phantom Shares.

(d) Settlement of Phantom Shares.

(i) Each vested and outstanding Phantom Share shall be settled by the transfer to the Grantee of one Share; provided, however, that, the Committee at the time of grant (or, in the appropriate case, as determined by the Committee, thereafter) may provide that a Phantom Share may be settled (A) in cash at the applicable Phantom Share Value, (B) in cash or by transfer of Shares as elected by the Grantee in accordance with procedures established by the Committee or (C) in cash or by transfer of Shares as elected by the Company.

(ii) Each Phantom Share shall be settled with a single-sum payment by the Company; provided, however, that, with respect to Phantom Shares of a Grantee which have a common Settlement Date (as defined below), the Committee may permit the Grantee to elect in accordance with procedures established by the Committee (taking into account, without limitation, Section 409A of the Code, as the Committee may deem appropriate) to receive installment payments over a period not to exceed 10 years. If the Grantee’s Phantom Shares are paid out in installment payments, such installment payments shall be treated as a series of separate payments for purposes of Section 409A of the Code.

(iii) Unless determined otherwise by the Committee in the applicable Agreement, the settlement date with respect to a Grantee is the first day of the month to follow the Grantee’s Termination of Service (“Settlement Date”); provided, however, that a Grantee may elect, in accordance with procedures to be adopted by the Committee, that such Settlement Date will be deferred as elected by the Grantee to a time permitted by the Committee under procedures to be established by the Committee. Notwithstanding the prior sentence, all initial elections to defer the Settlement Date shall be made in accordance with the requirements of `Section 409A of the Code.

(e) Other Phantom Share Provisions.

(i) Rights to payments with respect to Phantom Shares granted under the Plan shall not be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment,

 

13

pledge, encumbrance, attachment, garnishment, levy, execution, or other legal or equitable process, either voluntary or involuntary; and any attempt to anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber, attach or garnish, or levy or execute on any right to payments or other benefits payable hereunder, shall be void.

(ii) A Grantee may designate in writing, on forms to be prescribed by the Committee, a beneficiary or beneficiaries to receive any payments payable after his or her death and may amend or revoke such designation at any time. If no beneficiary designation is in effect at the time of a Grantee’s death, payments hereunder shall be made to the Grantee’s estate. If a Grantee with a vested Phantom Share dies, such Phantom Share shall be settled and the Phantom Share Value in respect of such Phantom Shares paid, and any payments deferred with respect thereto shall be accelerated and paid, as soon as practicable (but no later than 60 days) after the date of death to such Grantee’s beneficiary or estate, as applicable.

(iii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 10, any fractional Phantom Share will be paid out in cash at the Phantom Share Value as of the Settlement Date.

(iv) No Phantom Share shall give any Grantee any rights with respect to Shares or any ownership interest in the Company. Except as may be provided in accordance with Section 12, no provision of the Plan shall be interpreted to confer upon any Grantee of a Phantom Share any voting, dividend or derivative or other similar rights with respect to any Phantom Share.

(v) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, in no event may the Company provide any payment, cash or otherwise, to cancel or replace a Grant of Phantom Shares with a base value per Phantom Share greater than then Fair Market Value without first obtaining stockholder approval.

(f) Claims Procedures.

(i) The Grantee, or his beneficiary hereunder or authorized representative, may file a claim for payments with respect to Phantom Shares under the Plan by written communication to the Committee or its designee. A claim is not considered filed until such communication is actually received. Within 90 days (or, if special circumstances require an extension of time for processing, 180 days, in which case notice of such special circumstances should be provided within the initial 90-day period) after the filing of the claim, the Committee will either:

(1) approve the claim and take appropriate steps for satisfaction of the claim; or

(2) if the claim is wholly or partially denied, advise the claimant of such denial by furnishing to him or her a written notice of such denial setting forth (A) the specific reason or reasons for the denial; (B) specific reference to pertinent provisions of the Plan on which the denial is based and, if the denial is based in whole or in part on any rule of construction or interpretation adopted by the Committee, a reference to such rule, a copy of which shall be provided to the claimant; (C) a description of any additional material or

 

14

information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of the reasons why such material or information is necessary; and (D) a reference to this Section 11(f) as the provision setting forth the claims procedure under the Plan.

(ii) The claimant may request a review of any denial of his or her claim by written application to the Committee within 60 days after receipt of the notice of denial of such claim. Within 60 days (or, if special circumstances require an extension of time for processing, 120 days, in which case notice of such special circumstances should be provided within the initial 60-day period) after receipt of written application for review, the Committee will provide the claimant with its decision in writing, including, if the claimant’s claim is not approved, specific reasons for the decision and specific references to the Plan provisions on which the decision is based.

12. Provisions applicable to Dividend Equivalent Rights.

(a) Grant of DERs. Subject to the other terms of the Plan, the Committee shall, in its discretion as reflected by the terms of the Agreements, authorize the granting of DERs to Eligible Persons based on the dividends declared on Common Stock, to be credited as of the dividend payment dates, during the period between the date a Grant is issued, and the date such Grant is exercised, vests or expires, as determined by the Committee. Such DERs shall be converted to cash or additional Shares by such formula and at such time and subject to such limitation as may be determined by the Committee. With respect to DERs granted with respect to Options intended to be qualified performance-based compensation for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Code, such DERs shall be payable regardless of whether such Option is exercised. If a DER is granted in respect of another Grant hereunder, then, unless otherwise stated in the Agreement, or, in the appropriate case, as determined by the Committee, in no event shall the DER be in effect for a period beyond the time during which the applicable related portion of the underlying Grant has been exercised or otherwise settled, or has expired, been forfeited or otherwise lapsed, as applicable. With respect to DERs granted with respect to Grants that vest upon satisfaction of criteria other than solely continued service, payment in settlement of the DERs shall not be made to the Grantee prior to the date on which, and only to the extent that, the related Grant vests and the DERs shall be forfeited in the event, and to the extent, the related Grant is forfeited.

(b) Certain Terms.

(i) The term of a DER shall be set by the Committee in its discretion.

(ii) Payment of the amount determined in accordance with Section 12(a) shall be in cash, in Shares or a combination of the both, as determined by the Committee at the time of grant.

(c) Other Types of DERs. The Committee may establish a program under which DERs of a type whether or not described in the foregoing provisions of this Section 12 may be granted to Eligible Persons. For example, without limitation, the Committee may grant a DER in respect of each Share subject to an Option or with respect to a Phantom Share, which right would consist of the right (subject to Section 12(d)) to receive a cash payment in an amount equal to the dividend distributions paid on a Share from time to time.

 

15

(d) Deferral. The Committee may establish a program under which distributions with respect to DERs may be deferred. Such program may include, without limitation, provisions for the crediting of earnings and losses on unpaid amounts, and, if permitted by the Committee, provisions under which Grantees may select from among hypothetical investment alternatives for such deferred amounts in accordance with procedures established by the Committee.

13. Other Equity-Based Awards. The Board shall have the right to issue other Grants based upon the Shares or upon or covering LTIP Units having such terms and conditions as the Board may determine, including, without limitation, the grant of Shares or LTIP Units based upon specified conditions and the grant of securities convertible into Common Stock.

14. Performance Goals. The Committee, in its discretion, shall in the case of Grants (including, in particular, Grants other than Options) intended to qualify for an exception from the limitation imposed by Section 162(m) of the Code (“Performance-Based Grants”) (i) establish one or more performance goals (“Performance Goals”) as a precondition to the issue of Grants, and (ii) provide, in connection with the establishment of the Performance Goals, for predetermined Grants to those Grantees (who continue to meet all applicable eligibility requirements) with respect to whom the applicable Performance Goals are satisfied. The Performance Goals shall be based upon the criteria set forth in Exhibit A hereto which is hereby incorporated herein by reference as though set forth in full. The Performance Goals shall be established in a timely fashion such that they are considered preestablished for purposes of the rules governing performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code. Performance Goals which do not satisfy the foregoing provisions of this Section 14 may be established by the Committee with respect to Grants not intended to qualify for an exception from the limitations imposed by Section 162(m) of the Code.

15. Term of Plan. Grants may be granted pursuant to the Plan until the expiration of 10 years from the effective date of the Plan.

16. Recapitalization and Changes of Control.

(a) Subject to any required action by stockholders and to the specific provisions of Section 17, if (i) the Company shall at any time be involved in a merger, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation, reorganization, exchange of shares, sale of all or substantially all of the assets or stock of the Company or a transaction similar thereto, (ii) any stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, stock combination, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar change in the capital structure of the Company, or any distribution to holders of Common Stock other than ordinary cash dividends, shall occur or (iii) any other event shall occur which in the judgment of the Committee necessitates action by way of adjusting the terms of the outstanding Grants, then:

(i) the maximum aggregate number of Shares which may be made subject to Options and DERs under the Plan, the maximum aggregate number and kind of Shares

 

16

of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units that may be granted under the Plan, the maximum aggregate number of Phantom Shares and other Grants which may be granted under the Plan may be appropriately adjusted by the Committee in its discretion; and

(ii) the Committee shall take any such action as in its discretion shall be necessary to maintain each Grantees’ rights hereunder (including under their applicable Agreements) so that they are, in their respective Grants, substantially proportionate to the rights existing in such Grants prior to such event, including, without limitation, adjustments in (A) the number and kind of shares or other property to be distributed in respect of the Grant, (B) the Exercise Price, Purchase Price and Phantom Share Value, and (C) performance-based criteria established in connection with Grants (to the extent consistent with Section 162(m) of the Code, as applicable); provided that, in the discretion of the Committee, the foregoing clause (C) may also be applied in the case of any event relating to a Subsidiary if the event would have been covered under this Section 16(a) had the event related to the Company. In addition, the Committee may provide a cash bonus in lieu of adjustment if it determines such a bonus is appropriate.

To the extent that such action shall include an increase or decrease in the number of Shares (or units of other property then available) subject to all outstanding Grants, the number of Shares (or units) available under Section 6 above shall be increased or decreased, as the case may be, proportionately.

(b) Any Shares or other securities distributed to a Grantee with respect to Restricted Stock or otherwise issued in substitution of Restricted Stock pursuant to this Section 16 shall be subject to the restrictions and requirements imposed by Section 9, including depositing the certificates therefor with the Company together with a stock power and bearing a legend as provided in Section 9(c)(i).

(c) If the Company shall be consolidated or merged with another corporation or other entity, each Grantee who has received Restricted Stock that is then subject to restrictions imposed by Section 9(d) may be required to deposit with the successor corporation the certificates for the stock or securities or the other property that the Grantee is entitled to receive by reason of ownership of Restricted Stock in a manner consistent with Section 9(c)(ii), and such stock, securities or other property shall become subject to the restrictions and requirements imposed by Section 9(d), and the certificates therefor or other evidence thereof shall bear a legend similar in form and substance to the legend set forth in Section 9(c)(i).

(d) The judgment of the Committee with respect to any matter referred to in this Section 16 shall be conclusive and binding upon each Grantee without the need for any amendment to the Plan.

(e) Subject to any required action by stockholders, if the Company is the surviving corporation in any merger or consolidation, the rights under any outstanding Grant shall pertain and apply to the securities to which a holder of the number of Shares subject to the Grant would have been entitled. 

(f) To the extent that the foregoing adjustment related to securities of the Company, such adjustments shall be made by the Committee, whose determination shall be conclusive and binding on all persons.

(g) Except as expressly provided in this Section 16 , a Grantee shall have no rights by reason of subdivision or consolidation of shares of stock of any class, the payment of any stock dividend or any other increase or decrease in the number of shares of stock of any class or by reason of any dissolution, liquidation, merger or consolidation or spin-off of assets or stock of another corporation, and any issue by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall not affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number of Shares subject to a Grant or the Exercise Price of Shares subject to an Option.

(h) Grants made pursuant to the Plan shall not affect in any way the right or power of the Company to make adjustments, reclassifications, reorganizations or changes of its capital or business structure, to merge or consolidate or to dissolve, liquidate, sell or transfer all or any part of its business assets.

(i) Unless otherwise provided in the Agreement, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control:

(i) The Committee as constituted immediately before the Change of Control may make such adjustments to Grants as it, in its discretion, determines are necessary or appropriate in light of the Change of Control (including, without limitation, the substitution of stock other than stock of the Company as the Shares optioned hereunder), provided that the Committee determines that such adjustments do not have a substantial adverse economic impact on the Grantee as determined at the time of the adjustments.

(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 10 (taking into account, without limitation, the application of Section 409A of the Code, as the Committee may deem appropriate), the Settlement Date for Phantom Shares shall be the date of such Change of Control and all amounts due with respect to Phantom Shares to a Grantee hereunder shall be paid as soon as practicable (but in no event more than 30 days) after such Change of Control, unless such Grantee elects otherwise in accordance with procedures established by the Committee.

(iii) Vesting of all Grants shall accelerate in full, with Options being exercisable as to all of the covered Shares and all vesting criteria applicable to other Grants treated as having been fully satisfied, immediately prior to, put contingent on, the Change of Control.

(j) “Change of Control” shall mean the occurrence of any one of the following events:

(i) any “person,” including a “group,” (as such terms are used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act, but excluding the Company or the Advisor, any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Company or the Advisor, any trustee, fiduciary or other person or entity holding securities under any employee benefit plan or trust of the Company or the Advisor or any such entity, and, with respect to any particular

 

18

Eligible Employee, the Eligible Employee and any “group,” (as such term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) of which the Eligible Employee is a member), is or becomes the “beneficial owner,” (as defined in Rule 13(d)(3) under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing more than 50% of either (A) the combined voting power of the Company’s then outstanding securities or (B) the then outstanding Shares; or

(ii) members of the Board at the beginning of any consecutive 12-calendar-month period (the “Incumbent Directors”) cease for any reason other than due to death to constitute at least a majority of the members of the Board; provided that any Director whose election, or nomination for election by the Company’s stockholders, was approved or ratified by a vote of at least a majority of the members of the Board then still in office who were members of the Board at the beginning of such 12-calendar-month period, shall be deemed to be an Incumbent Director; or

(iii) there shall occur (A) any consolidation or merger of the Company or any Subsidiary where the stockholders of the Company, immediately prior to the consolidation or merger, would not, immediately after the consolidation or merger, beneficially own (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, shares representing in the aggregate 50% or more of the voting securities of the corporation issuing cash or securities in the consolidation or merger (or of its ultimate parent corporation, if any), (B) any sale, lease, exchange or other transfer (in one transaction or a series of transactions contemplated or arranged by any party as a single plan) of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or (C) the liquidation or dissolution of the Company.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no event or condition described in clauses (i) through (iii) above shall constitute a Change of Control if it results from a transaction between the Company and the Advisor, or an affiliate of the Advisor.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a “Change of Control” shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of the foregoing clause (i) solely as the result of an acquisition of securities by the Company which, by reducing the number of Shares or other voting securities outstanding, increases (x) the proportionate number of Shares beneficially owned by any person to 50% or more of the Shares then outstanding or (y) the proportionate voting power represented by the voting securities beneficially owned by any person to 50% or more of the combined voting power of all then outstanding voting securities; provided, however, that, if any person referred to in clause (x) or (y) of this sentence shall thereafter become the beneficial owner of any additional Shares or other voting securities (other than pursuant to a stock split, stock dividend, or similar transaction), then a “Change of Control” shall be deemed to have occurred for purposes of this subsection (j).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no event or condition shall constitute a Change of Control to the extent that, if it were, an excise tax would be imposed upon or with respect to any Grant under Section 409A of the Code; provided that, in such a case, the event or condition shall continue to constitute a Change of Control to the maximum extent possible (e.g., if applicable, in respect of vesting without an acceleration of distribution) without causing the imposition of such excise tax.

 

19

17. Effect of Certain Transactions. In the case of (i) the dissolution or liquidation of the Company, (ii) a merger, consolidation, reorganization or other business combination in which the Company is acquired by another entity or in which the Company is not the surviving entity, or (iii) any sale, lease, exchange or other transfer (in one transaction or a series of transactions contemplated or arranged by any party as a single plan) of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, the Plan and the Grants issued hereunder shall terminate upon the effectiveness of any such transaction or event, unless provision is made in connection with such transaction for the assumption of Grants theretofore granted, or the substitution for such Grants of new Grants, by the successor entity or parent thereof, with appropriate adjustment as to the number and kind of shares and the per share exercise prices, as provided in Section 16.

18. Securities Law Requirements.

(a) Legality of Issuance. The issuance of any Shares pursuant to Grants under the Plan and the issuance of any Grant shall be contingent upon the following:

(i) the obligation of the Company to sell Shares with respect to Grants issued under the Plan shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including all applicable federal and state securities laws, and the obtaining of all such approvals by governmental agencies as may be deemed necessary or appropriate by the Committee;

(ii) the Committee may make such changes to the Plan as may be necessary or appropriate to comply with the rules and regulations of any government authority or to obtain tax benefits applicable to stock options; and

(iii) each grant of Options, Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Phantom Shares (or issuance of Shares in respect thereof) or DERs (or issuance of Shares in respect thereof), or other Grant under Section 13 (or issuance of Shares in respect thereof), is subject to the requirement that, if at any time the Committee determines, in its discretion, that the listing, registration or qualification of Shares issuable pursuant to the Plan is required by any securities exchange or under any state or federal law, or the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory body is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, the issuance of Options, Shares of Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Phantom Shares, DERs, other Grants or other Shares, no payment shall be made, or Phantom Shares or Shares issued or grant of Restricted Stock or other Grant made, in whole or in part, unless listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval has been effected or obtained free of any conditions in a manner acceptable to the Committee.

(b) Restrictions on Transfer. Regardless of whether the offering and sale of Shares under the Plan has been registered under the Act or has been registered or qualified under the securities laws of any state, the Company may impose restrictions on the sale, pledge or other transfer of such Shares (including the placement of appropriate legends on stock certificates) if, in the judgment of the Company and its counsel, such restrictions are necessary or desirable in order to achieve compliance with the provisions of the Act, the securities laws of any state or any other law. In the event that the sale of Shares under the Plan is not registered under the Act but an exemption is available which requires an investment representation or other representation, each Grantee shall be required to represent that such Shares are being acquired for investment,

 

20

and not with a view to the sale or distribution thereof, and to make such other representations as are deemed necessary or appropriate by the Company and its counsel. Any determination by the Company and its counsel in connection with any of the matters set forth in this Section 18 shall be conclusive and binding on all persons. Without limiting the generality of Section 6, certificates evidencing Shares acquired under the Plan pursuant to an unregistered transaction shall bear a restrictive legend, substantially in the following form, and such other restrictive legends as are required or deemed advisable under the provisions of any applicable law:

“THE SALE OF THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 (THE “ACT”). ANY TRANSFER OF SUCH SECURITIES WILL BE INVALID UNLESS A REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE ACT IS IN EFFECT AS TO SUCH TRANSFER OR IN THE OPINION OF COUNSEL FOR THE ISSUER SUCH REGISTRATION IS UNNECESSARY IN ORDER FOR SUCH TRANSFER TO COMPLY WITH THE ACT.”

(c) Registration or Qualification of Securities. The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, register or qualify the issuance of Grants and/or the sale of Shares under the Act or any other applicable law. The Company shall not be obligated to take any affirmative action in order to cause the issuance of Grants or the sale of Shares under the Plan to comply with any law.

(d) Exchange of Certificates. If, in the opinion of the Company and its counsel, any legend placed on a certificate representing Shares sold under the Plan is no longer required, the holder of such certificate shall be entitled to exchange such certificate for a certificate representing the same number of Shares but lacking such legend.

(e) Certain Loans. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Company shall not be required to take or permit any action under the Plan or any Agreement which, in the good-faith determination of the Company, would result in a risk of a violation by the Company of Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act.

19. Amendment of the Plan/Awards. The Board may from time to time, with respect to any Shares at the time not subject to Grants, suspend or discontinue the Plan or revise or amend it, or any outstanding Grants, in any respect, subject to the limitations of the Plan. The Board may amend the Plan as it shall deem advisable, except that no amendment may adversely affect a Grantee with respect to Grants previously granted; provided, however, that the Plan may not be amended without stockholder approval (a) to increase the total number of Shares that may be subject to Awards set forth in Section 6 (other than through an adjustment as provided otherwise in the Plan), (b) to change the class of Eligible Persons, (c) to reprice any awards under the Plan, or (d) in any other manner that in the absence of stockholder approval would cause the Plan to fail to comply with any applicable legal requirement or applicable exchange or similar state law requirements.

20. Application of Funds. The proceeds received by the Company from the sale of Shares pursuant to the exercise of an Option, the sale of Restricted Stock or in connection with other Grants under the Plan will be used for general corporate purposes.

 

21

21. Tax Withholding. Each Grantee shall, no later than the date as of which the value of any Grant first becomes includable in the gross income of the Grantee for federal income tax purposes, pay to the Company, or make arrangements satisfactory to the Company regarding payment of any federal, state or local taxes of any kind that are required by law to be withheld with respect to such income. A Grantee may elect to have such tax withholding satisfied, in whole or in part, by (i) authorizing the Company to withhold a number of Shares to be issued pursuant to a Grant equal to the Fair Market Value as of the date withholding is effected that would satisfy the withholding amount due, (ii) transferring to the Company Shares owned by the Grantee with a Fair Market Value equal to the amount of the required withholding tax, or (iii) in the case of a Grantee who is an Employee of the Company at the time such withholding is effected, by withholding from the Grantee’s cash compensation. Notwithstanding anything contained in the Plan to the contrary, the Grantee’s satisfaction of any tax-withholding requirements imposed by the Committee shall be a condition precedent to the Company’s obligation as may otherwise by provided hereunder to provide Shares to the Grantee, and the failure of the Grantee to satisfy such requirements with respect to a Grant shall cause such Grant to be forfeited.

22. Notices. All notices under the Plan shall be in writing, and if to the Company, shall be delivered to the Board or mailed to its principal office, addressed to the attention of the Board; and if to the Grantee, shall be delivered personally or mailed to the Grantee at the address appearing in the records of the Participating Company. Such addresses may be changed at any time by written notice to the other party given in accordance with this Section 22.

23. Rights to Employment or Other Service. Nothing in the Plan or in any Grant issued pursuant to the Plan shall confer on any individual any right to continue in the employ or other service of the Participating Company (if applicable) or interfere in any way with the right of the Participating Company and its stockholders to terminate the individual’s employment or other service at any time.

24. Exculpation and Indemnification. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless the members of the Board and the members of the Committee from and against any and all liabilities, costs and expenses incurred by such persons as a result of any act or omission to act in connection with the performance of such person’s duties, responsibilities and obligations under the Plan, other than such liabilities, costs and expenses as may result from the gross negligence, bad faith, willful misconduct or criminal acts of such persons.

25. Compliance with Section 409A of the Code.

(a) Any Agreement issued under the Plan that is subject to Section 409A of the Code shall include such additional terms and conditions as may be required to satisfy the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.

(b) With respect to any Grant issued under the Plan that is subject to Section 409A of the Code, and with respect to which a payment or distribution is to be made upon a Termination of Service, if the Grantee is determined by the Company to be a “specified employee” within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code and any of the

 

22

Company’s stock is publicly traded on an established securities market or otherwise, such payment or distribution may not be made before the date which is six months after the date of Termination of Service (to the extent required under Section 409A of the Code). Any payments or distributions delayed in accordance with the prior sentence shall be paid to the Grantee on the first day of the seventh month following the Grantee’s Termination of Service.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Board and the Committee shall administer the Plan, and exercise authority and discretion under the Plan, to satisfy the requirements of Section 409A of the Code or any exemption thereto.

26. No Fund Created. Any and all payments hereunder to any Grantee under the Plan shall be made from the general funds of the Company (or, if applicable, a Participating Company). The obligations of the Company (or, if applicable, a Participating Company) under the Plan are unsecured and constitute a mere promise by the Company (or, if applicable, a Participating Company) to make benefit payments in the future and, to the extent that any person acquires a right to receive payments under the Plan from the Company (or, if applicable, a Participating Company), such right shall be no greater than the right of a general unsecured creditor of the Company (or, if applicable, a Participating Company). Without limiting the foregoing, Phantom Shares and any other similar devices issued hereunder to account for Plan obligations are solely a device for the measurement and determination of the amounts to be paid to a Grantee under the Plan, and each Grantee’s right in the Phantom Shares and any such other devices is limited to the right to receive payment, if any, as may herein be provided.

27. No Fiduciary Relationship. Nothing contained in the Plan, and no action taken pursuant to the provisions of the Plan, shall create or shall be construed to create a trust of any kind, or a fiduciary relationship between the Company, the Participating Companies, or their officers or the Committee, on the one hand, and the Grantee, the Company, the Participating Companies or any other person or entity, on the other.

28. Captions. The use of captions in the Plan is for convenience. The captions are not intended to provide substantive rights.

29. Governing Law. THE PLAN SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF MARYLAND, WITHOUT REFERENCE TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICT OF LAWS.

written assurances in substance and form satisfactory to the Optionor to the effect that
such Optionee is acquiring the Optioned Shares subject to the Option for his or her own
account for investment and not with any present intention of selling or otherwise
distributing the same, and to such other effects as the Optionor deems necessary or
appropriate in order to comply with federal and applicable state or provincial securities
laws, including the Securities Act (Ontario) and the United States Securities Act of 1933,
both as amended (all such legislation, regulations, and rules made thereunder,
“Applicable Laws”), or with covenants or representations made by the Optionor in
connection with any public offering of its common shares. The Optionee represents
warrants and covenants that:
(i) Any Optioned Shares purchased upon exercise of the Option shall be acquired for
the Optionee’s account for investment only, and not with a view to, or for sale in
connection with, any distribution of the shares in contravention or circumvention
of Applicable Laws.
(ii) The Optionee has had such opportunity as he or she has deemed adequate to
obtain from representatives of the Optionor such information as is necessary to
permit the Optionee to evaluate the merits and risks of his or her investment in
the Optionor.
(iii) The Optionee is able to bear the economic risk of holding the Optioned Shares
acquired pursuant to the exercise of the Option during the Exercise Period.
(a) By making payment upon exercise of the Option, the Optionee shall be deemed to have
reaffirmed, as of the date of such payment, the representations made in this Section 8.
Anti-Dilution
10. (a) If, after the date hereof, the Optionor subdivides, redivides, combines, consolidates,
reclassifies or otherwise changes its then outstanding Common Shares into a greater or
lesser number of Common Shares or different shares, upon exercise of the Option granted
pursuant to this Agreement the Optionee shall be entitled to receive and shall accept, in
lieu of the number of Common Shares to which the Optionee is entitled upon the exercise
of the Option, the aggregate number and variety of shares of the Optionor to which the
Optionee would have been entitled as a result of such subdivision, redivision,
combination, consolidation, reclassification or other change.
(a) If there is a capital reorganization of the Optionor or other change in the Common Shares
not covered by section 10(a) or a consolidation, merger or amalgamation of the Optionor
with or into any other Optionor or entity (other than a consolidation, merger or
amalgamation which does not result in any reclassification of the outstanding Common
Shares or a change of the Common Shares into other securities) or a transfer of all or
substantially all of the Optionor’s undertaking and assets to another Optionor or entity in
which the holders of Common Shares are entitled to receive shares, other securities or
property (a “Capital Reorganization”), the Optionee shall be entitled to receive and
shall accept, in lieu of the number of Common Shares to which the Optionee is entitled
upon the exercise of the Option, the aggregate number and variety of shares or other
4
securities or property which the Optionee would have been entitled to receive as a result
of such Capital Reorganization.
(b) Any adjustments made pursuant to this section 10 shall be subject to the following rules
and procedures:
(i) the adjustments provided for are cumulative and shall be made successively
whenever an event referred to herein shall occur;
(ii) if the Optionor sets a record date to take any action and thereafter and before
taking such action abandons its plan to take such action, then no adjustment shall
be required by reason of setting such record date;
(iii) upon the occurrence of each and every event set out in this section 10, the
provisions of this Agreement shall ipso facto be deemed to be amended
accordingly and the Optionor shall take all necessary action to comply with such
provisions as so amended;
(iv) if the Optionor takes any action affecting the Common Shares after the date
hereof, other than any action described in this section 10, which in the reasonable
opinion of the board of directors of the Optionor would materially affect the
rights of the Optionee or the number of Common Shares which may be issued
upon exercise of the Option pursuant to this Agreement, this Agreement shall be
amended in such manner and at such time as the board of directors of the
Optionor in its sole discretion may determine to be equitable in the
circumstances; provided that failure of the Optionor to make such an adjustment
shall be prima facie evidence that the board of directors of the Optionor has
determined that it is equitable to make no adjustment in the circumstances. If
any such adjustment is made, the Optionor shall deliver a notice to the Optionee
describing such adjustment;
(v) in case a state of facts exists to which the provisions of this section 10 are not
strictly applicable or, if strictly applicable, operate in an unclear manner or in a
manner that would not fairly adjust the rights of the Optionee against dilution in
accordance with the intent and purposes of this section 10, the Optionor shall
execute and deliver to the Optionee an amendment to this section 10 providing
for an adjustment in the application of such provisions so as to adjust such rights
in accordance with the advice of legal counsel to whom the Optionor may refer
any such question;
(vi) in the event of any question arising with respect to the adjustments provided in
this section 10, such question shall be submitted for determination by the auditors
or accountants, as applicable, of the Optionor and such determination shall be
binding upon the Optionor and the Optionee;
(vii) as a condition precedent to the taking of any action which would result in an
adjustment to the Common Shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement, the
Optionor shall take any corporate action which may be necessary in order that the
Common Shares to which the Optionee are entitled upon exercise of the Option
in accordance with the provisions hereof shall be available for such purpose and
5
that such Common Shares may be validly and legally issued as fully paid and
non-assessable; and
(viii) the Optionor shall, from time to time immediately after the occurrence of any
event which requires an adjustment in the number of Common Shares issuable
pursuant to the exercise of the Option, deliver a certificate of a senior officer of
the Optionor to the Optionee specifying the nature of the event requiring the
adjustment and the adjustment thereby necessitated and setting forth in
reasonable detail the adjusted number of Common Shares, method of calculation
and the facts upon which such calculation is based.

FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
Status
Reasonable assurance of quality was confirmed for Status
Determinations and Status Posting functions. The Acceptance
Samples for New, Successor, and Inactivation Determinations all
passed the review which validated the effectiveness of the internal
controls. The Systems Review, however, did identify a potential
risk in the Status successor area.
The Computed Measures indicated that both New and Successor
Status Determinations were completed in a timely manner. The
percentages for New Status determinations were 81.2% made within
90 days and 99.3% in 180 days. The percentages for Successor
Status determinations were 89.3% made within 90 days and 99.7%
in 180 days.
Cashiering
Reasonable assurance of quality was confirmed for the Cashiering
function. The Systems Review verified the existence of the
necessary internal controls, and no risks were identified. The
Acceptance Sample cases all passed, and the three verification tests
also passed, which validated the effectiveness of the internal
controls.
Report Delinquency
Reasonable assurance of quality was confirmed in this function.
The Program Review findings indicated that all internal controls
were present and operating effectively. The absence of risks in the
Systems Review was consistent with no errors found in the
Acceptance Sample cases.

Report Delinquency (cont.)
The Computed Measures indicated that the State is doing very well
in securing and resolving report delinquencies. The State had
91.7% of the contribution reports filed timely; 94.1% of reports
were secured by the end of the following quarter; and 99.1% of
reports were secured or resolved within 180 days.
Collections
In the Collections function, the Systems Review findings indicated
that all internal controls were present and the Acceptance Sample
cases verified that the collection procedures were being adhered to;
however, the findings from the Computed Measures indicated that
the State was not effective in managing accounts receivable.
The Computed Measures imply that the State is experiencing
problems in collecting past due taxes. The percent of contributory
employers making timely payments (Indicator 1) was 91.1%, the
turnover of receivables (Indicator 2) was 1.3%, the percent declared
uncollectible (Indicator 3) was 0.6%, and the percent of unpaid
contributions/reimbursements due (Indicator 4) was 7.4%. These
percentages indicate that the SESA may not be collecting tax dollars
past due in a timely manner, and is not currently reducing the
overall level of accounts receivable which has been static for the
past three years.

Field Audit
Reasonable assurance of quality was not confirmed for the Field
Audit function. The Systems Review identified a risk in the
recording of transactions and events. This lack of documentation
has been addressed since the TPS Review, and refresher training for
all field auditors is planned for the near future. Due to the actions
being taken to correct this weakness, a marked improvement is
anticipated by the time the next TPS review takes place.
The results of the three computed measures indicated overall, that
the State has managed the field audit program well for the review
year. The percent of change in total wages audited was 14.3%, the
audit penetration rate of 2.8% exceeded the DOL penetration level
requirements, and the percent of total wages audited was 4.0%
Account Maintenance
Reasonable assurance of quality in the Account Maintenance
function was confirmed for all areas except in Employer
Debits/Billings. The Systems Reviews conducted for Contribution
Report Processing, Employer Credits/Refunds, Benefit Charging,
and Employer Tax Rates indicated that all necessary controls were
present; and the Acceptance Samples for these areas validated the
effectiveness of those controls.
The Systems Review conducted for Employer Debits/Billings also
revealed no risks, and indicated that all internal controls were
present; however, the Acceptance Samples cases identified errors in
billing employers properly. The contributing factors were
subsequently identified, and actions have been taken to resolve this
problem.

Global/Systemic or Other Miscellaneous Findings
In conducting the Systems Reviews for the various tax functions, a
lack of written procedures was found to exist in several functions.
The Tax Unit staff has been advised of these findings, and they are
taking steps to work with the Technical Support unit to write
procedures for these functions as time and money permit.
Exemplary Findings
An exemplary practice was identified in the Account Maintenance
function for Benefit Charging. The State's automated system
reconciles each benefit check by individual social security number
to each employer's account attached to the claim. This
reconciliation is performed daily. Such a control assures the State
that all benefits paid are accurately allocated to the proper
employer's account or to the general pool account.
RECOMMENDATIONS
Collections
It is recommended that the Collections Unit implement additional
procedures and/or tools to more effectively manage accounts
receivable. E. g., immediate lien filing for chronic employers and
automated lien filing for accounts over 60 days old.

RECOMMENDATIONS (cont.)
Field Audit
In the Field Audit unit, refresher training should be provided to
assure that all field auditors are aware of the documentation
requirements. A review system should be implemented to assure
that the audits are meeting the documentation requirements. Audits
completed by auditors who are more prone to err may require more
extensive review.
Account Maintenance (Employer Debits/Billings)
The computer program for employer billings needs to be modified to
reject contribution reports not properly prepared for the scanner.
Clarification to the written procedures needs to be provided to notify
all staff that black #2 pencils should be used in preparing reports for
the scanner. The supervisor of this unit could consider
implementing a review to assure that staff is properly completing the
reports to be scanned.
Global/Systemic and Miscellaneous
The Tax staff should take steps to begin the process of writing
procedures for each unit where a risk was identified in the area of
recording information and instructions.
Other
Outside the scope of the TPS Review in Cashiering, a non-
sufficient-funds check was discovered on a claims overpayment that
had been charged back to the Benefit Payment Account, but had not
been added back to the amount of the claimant's overpayment. The
Benefit Payment Control Unit was notified and the procedures were
amended to prevent future problems of this type.

INSIDER TRADING AND REPORTING POLICY
I. INTRODUCTION
Employees, officers, directors, consultants, contractors and agents of NexGen Energy Ltd.
(the “Corporation”) (together with its controlled entities, other than those controlled entities
that have securities listed on a securities exchange and are subject to their own corporate
governance standards and policies, "NexGen") may from time to time become shareholders
of the Corporation on a long- term investment basis. These individuals will from time to time
become aware of corporate developments, plans or other information that may affect the
value of the Corporation's securities, or that a reasonable investor would be likely to
consider important in making an investment decision about the Corporation's securities,
before these developments, plans or information are made public. Trading securities of the
Corporation while in possession of such information before it is generally disclosed, or
disclosing such information to third parties before it is generally disclosed (known as
"tipping"), may expose an individual to criminal prosecution or civil lawsuits. Such action will
also result in a lack of confidence in the market for the Corporation's securities, thus harming
the Corporation and its shareholders. Accordingly, the Corporation has established this
Policy to assist the NexGen’s Personnel (as described below) in complying with the
prohibitions against insider trading and tipping under applicable Canadian, United States and
other securities laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, Section 401(f) of the
NYSE MKT LLC Company Guide.
It is important that all Personnel review this Policy carefully. Non-compliance with this
Policy is grounds for immediate dismissal. Failure to comply with the policies and
procedures set forth below can also result in a serious violation of applicable
securities laws, leading potentially to both civil and criminal penalties.
The procedures and restrictions set forth in this Policy with respect to the trading of common
shares, preferred shares, convertible debentures and any other securities by Personnel are
only a general framework within which Personnel may purchase and sell securities without
violating applicable securities laws. Personnel have the ultimate responsibility for
complying with applicable securities laws.
The Corporation's Board of Directors (the "Board") will designate one (1) or more individuals
from time to time as Insider Trading Policy Administrators for the purpose of administering
this Policy. At the date hereof, the designated Insider Trading Policy Administrator is the
General Counsel of the Corporation. This Policy will be reviewed periodically by the Board.
II. APPLICATION
The following persons are required to observe and comply with this Policy:
• all directors, officers, employees, consultants, contractors and agents of
NexGen, from time to time
• any family member (including an adult interdependent partner) or other
person living in the household or a dependent child of any of the foregoing
individuals;
• "affiliates" (as defined below) of any of the above-mentioned individuals; and
2
• partnerships, trusts, estates, corporations and other similar entities over
which any of the above-mentioned individuals exercise control or direction
(including by acting as trustee or in a similar capacity).
For the purposes of this Policy, the persons listed above are collectively referred to as the
"Personnel."
For the purposes of this Policy, an "affiliate" is: (i) with respect to a specified person, an
affiliate of another person is a person that directly, or indirectly through one or more
intermediaries, controls or is controlled by, or is under common control with, the person
specified, and (ii) with respect to a company, such company is deemed to be an affiliate of
another company if one of them is the subsidiary of the other or if both are subsidiaries of
the same company or if each of them is controlled by the same person or company. Affiliate
status is a facts and circumstances determination, but officers, directors and significant
shareholders of an entity and partners of a partnership are generally deemed to be affiliates
of the entity or partnership, as applicable, for the purpose of this Policy.
For the purposes of this Policy, all references to trading in securities of the Corporation is
deemed to include: (i) trading the Corporation's common shares, including those held in
RRSP's, RESP's and TFSA's; (ii) the exercise of options granted under the Corporation's
option plan; and (iii) any instrument that derives its value from the price of the Corporation's
shares (commonly known as a "derivative"), including convertible debentures.
III. INSIDE INFORMATION
"Inside Information" means:
• a change in the business, operations or capital of NexGen that would
reasonably be expected to have a significant effect on the market price or
value of the securities of the Corporation (which includes any decision to
implement such a change by the Board or by senior management of the
Corporation who believe that confirmation of the decision by the Board is
probable);
• a fact that significantly affects, or would reasonably be expected to have a
significant effect on, the market price or value of the securities of the
Corporation; or
• any information which is not generally available to the public that a
reasonable investor would be likely to consider important in deciding whether
to buy, hold or sell securities of the Corporation,
in each case, which has not been generally disclosed. Examples of information that may
constitute Inside Information are set out in Schedule "A" attached hereto.
For purposes of insider trading liability, it does not matter that delaying the transaction until
the material fact or material change is disclosed or ceases to be material might cause the
Personnel to incur a financial loss. In addition, it does not matter that Personnel may have
decided to engage in a transaction to trade in securities of the Corporation before learning of
the undisclosed material fact or material change. Further, it also is irrelevant that publicly
disclosed information about NexGen would, without consideration of the undisclosed
material fact or material change, provide a substantial basis for engaging in the transaction.
Subject to Subsection VI.(A.) of this Policy, which requires that certain Personnel pre-clear
trades in securities of the Corporation, it is the responsibility of any Personnel contemplating
a trade in securities of the Corporation to determine prior to such trade whether he or she is
aware of any information that constitutes Inside Information. If in doubt, the individual should
consult with the Insider Trading Policy Administrator.
3
IV. PROHIBITION AGAINST TRADING ON INSIDE INFORMATION
Personnel must not purchase, sell or otherwise trade securities of the Corporation with the
knowledge of Inside Information until:
• the opening of markets on the second full trading day (or such shorter period as is
approved in writing by the Insider Trading Policy Administrator) after the disclosure to
the public of the Inside Information, whether by way of press release or a filing made
with securities regulatory authorities; or
• the Inside Information ceases to be material (e.g. a potential transaction that was the
subject of the information is abandoned, and either Personnel are so advised by the
Insider Trading Policy Administrator or such abandonment has been generally
disclosed); or
• at any time, if the Insider Trading Policy Administrator is aware of any information
that restricts Personnel from trading.
V. NO SPECULATING, SHORT-SELLING, PUTS AND CALLS
Trading in securities of the Corporation by Personnel with access to Inside Information may
give rise to actual or perceived contraventions of applicable securities laws and/or
inappropriate conflicts of interest. To assist Personnel in undertaking trades of securities that
do not result in such contraventions or conflicts, Personnel are prohibited from, directly or
indirectly, undertaking any of the following activities, without prior written approval by the
President and Chief Executive Officer, or in the case of activities undertaken by the
President and Chief Executive Officer, by the Chair of the Board:
• speculating in securities of the Corporation, which may include day trading;
• buying the Corporation's securities on margin;
• short selling a security of the Corporation or any other arrangement that
results in a gain only if the value of the Corporation's securities declines in the
future;
• selling or buying a "call option" giving the holder an option to purchase
securities of the Corporation;
• buying or selling a "put option" giving the holder an option to sell securities of
the Corporation; and
• any other transaction similar to the foregoing.
VI. RESTRICTIONS ON TRADING OF THE CORPORATION'S SECURITIES
A. Trading Pre-Clearance
To assist each of the Personnel specified below to avoid undertaking any trade in securities
of the Corporation that may contravene or be perceived to contravene applicable securities
laws, the following individuals are required to notify the Insider Trading Policy Administrator
of any proposed trade of securities of the Corporation in order to confirm that there is no
Inside Information that has not been generally disclosed:
• a director or officer of NexGen;
• an individual that is notified by the Insider Trading Policy Administrator that
the individual's trades in securities of the Corporation will be subject to pre-
clearance in accordance with this Policy;
4
• a family member (including an adult interdependent partner) or other person
living in the household or a dependent child of any of the foregoing
individuals; and
• such other persons as the Chief Executive Officer or President of the
Corporation may designate as being subject to the trading pre-clearance
restrictions.
Such notification shall be made in writing (e-mail or written notice) ("Trade Notice") to the
Insider Trading Policy Administrator no later than 9:00 a.m. (Vancouver time) on the
business day before the date of the proposed transaction (or such shorter period as the
Insider Trading Policy Administrator may permit in his or her sole discretion) and no earlier
than five (5) business days before the date of the proposed transaction. The Insider Trading
Policy Administrator may consult with outside counsel regarding Trade Notices. Prior to 5:00
p.m. (Vancouver time) on the business day preceding the date of the proposed transaction,
the Insider Trading Policy Administrator shall notify any individual that has given a Trade
Notice in accordance with this Policy whether the Insider Trading Policy Administrator
reasonably anticipates that any proposed trade will contravene applicable securities laws
and/or this Policy, and if so, that the proposed trade may not be undertaken. The Insider
Trading Policy Administrator will respond to all Trade Notices.
B. Black-out Periods
At any time, and from time to time, the Insider Trading Policy Administrator may issue a
notice instructing any or all Personnel to which the Insider Trading Policy Administrator has
determined the blackout should extend, not to trade in securities of the Corporation until
further notice (each, a “Black-out Period”).
The trading restrictions described above apply to the exercise of options granted under the
Corporation's option plan, and any other securities acquired pursuant to any benefit plan or
arrangement of the Corporation. Automatic purchases of shares in accordance with pre-
existing standing instructions under any savings plan and dividend reinvestment plan that
may be implemented by the Corporation may continue during Blackout Periods, but
Personnel are prohibited from changing standing instructions, enrolling or exiting from the
plans, making any lump sum purchases or selling shares through the plans while in
possession of Inside Information.
C. Rule 10b5-1 and Other Pre-Arranged Trading Plans
Rule 10b5-1 under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, provides an
affirmative defense from insider trading liability under U.S. securities laws. If Personnel
desire to rely on this defense for future trading on the Corporation’s securities and if
permitted under applicable Canadian securities laws, they are permitted to, and must first,
enter into a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan that meets the requirements for such a plan and is
approved in writing by the Insider Trading Policy Administrator.
Personnel may also enter into a pre-arranged structured trading plan or automatic security
disposition plan for future trading in the Corporation’s securities, provided such plan
complies with applicable securities laws and is approved in writing by the Insider Trading
Policy Administrator.
VII. PROHIBITION AGAINST TIPPING
Personnel are prohibited from communicating Inside Information to others. If any Personnel
has any doubt with respect to whether any information is Inside Information, the individual is
required to contact the Insider Trading Policy Administrator. Inside Information is to be kept
strictly confidential by all Personnel until after it has been generally disclosed, except to the
extent permitted by applicable law and the Corporation's policies, and authorized by the
5
Insider Trading Policy Administrator. Personnel are directed to the Corporation's Disclosure
Policy for additional information regarding communications with non-employees.
VIII. SECURITIES OF OTHER COMPANIES
In the course of the Corporation's business, Personnel may obtain information about another
publicly traded issuer that has not been generally disclosed. Securities laws generally
prohibit trading in securities of that company while in possession of such information or
communicating such information to another person. The restrictions set out in this Policy
apply to all Personnel with respect to trading in the securities of another issuer while in
possession of such information, and communicating such information.
IX. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
The directors and officers of NexGen are "Reporting Insiders" under applicable Canadian
securities laws. If you are uncertain as to whether you are a Reporting Insider, you must
contact the Insider Trading Policy Administrator.
Under applicable Canadian securities laws, a person or corporation who becomes a
Reporting Insider of the Corporation must file an insider report within the prescribed period
after becoming a Reporting Insider and thereafter upon any change in the Reporting
Insider’s holdings, all in accordance with applicable securities laws.
It is each Reporting Insider's personal responsibility to ensure that all requisite insider
trading reports are filed with the appropriate securities commissions within the prescribed
statutory time limits.
The Insider Trading Policy Administrator will assist any Reporting Insider in the preparation
and filing of insider reports upon request.
Affiliates of the Corporation must also ensure that they comply with all applicable reporting
requirements under United States securities laws, including, if applicable, the filing of a Form
144 in connection with transactions in the Corporation's securities.
X. ENFORCEMENT
All Personnel, from time to time, will be provided with a copy of this Policy. It is a condition of
their appointment or employment that each of these individuals at all times abide by the
standards, requirements and procedures set out in this Policy unless a written authorization
to proceed otherwise is received from the Insider Trading Policy Administrator. Any such
individual who violates this Policy may face disciplinary action up to and including
termination of his or her employment or appointment with the Corporation without notice.
The violation of this Policy may also violate certain securities laws. If it appears that an
employee, officer, director, consultants, contractors or agents may have violated such
securities laws, the Corporation may refer the matter to the appropriate regulatory or law
enforcement authorities, which could lead to penalties, fines or imprisonment.
Should you have any questions or wish information concerning the above, please contact
the Insider Trading Policy Administrator.
This Policy was last approved by the Board of Directors on April 4, 2017.

SCHEDULE "A"
Common examples of Inside Information may include:
• pending offerings of common shares or securities convertible into common
shares;

MD_DOCS_A #1137583 v8 8

or merger of either of AES or FMA with or into any other entity, other than a merger or
consolidation in which an Affiliate of Buyer remains the ultimate owner of such entity or
(iii) any sale or disposition by either AES or FMA of all or substantially all of its assets
other than a sale to a third party which is an Affiliate of the Buyer.
(d) Calculation of EBITDA and Payment of Performance Payments.
(i) "Actual EBITDA" is to be calculated as the combined net income of the
Targets on an accrual basis in accordance with GAAP (as converted with respect to the
Target Corporations and consistent with past practices with respect to the Target
Partnerships) and as set forth in the EBITDA Forecast attached hereto as Schedule A,
plus depreciation and amortization (not including depreciation or amortization from any
capital investments made after Closing and agreed to by Fellon and McCord), plus all
taxes based on all federal, state and local net income, plus interest expenses (not
including any interest charges relating to funds borrowed or advanced by Buyer or any of
its Affiliates and agreed to by Fellon and McCord, which shall be for the accounts of
FMA or AES, as appropriate) minus interest income. For purposes of this calculation,
income for FMA and AES must be derived from the core services of Targets set forth in
Section 1 of Exhibit A attached hereto and shared revenues from the complimentary
services set forth in Section 3 of Exhibit A attached hereto. Actual EBITDA shall be
calculated prior to bonus payments to Fellon and McCord under their Management
Agreements and prior to amortization of good will arising from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Actual EBITDA shall not include any management
fees, charges for parent guaranties or other corporate charges imposed by Buyer or any of
its Affiliates unless such other charges relate to services requested by Fellon and McCord
to be performed by Buyer or any of its Affiliates.
(ii) As soon as practicable, but in no event later than 90 calendar days following
each of Years 1, 2 and 3, Fellon and McCord shall prepare and deliver to the Buyer a
calculation (the "EBITDA Calculation") of EBITDA for the foregoing years. After
receipt of the applicable EBITDA Calculation, the Buyer shall have 30 calendar days to
review the EBITDA Calculation, together with the workpapers used in the preparation
thereof. The Buyer and its accountants shall have full access during regular business
hours with reasonable advance notice to all relevant books, records and employees of the
Targets relating to the applicable EBITDA Calculation and the Targets accountants and
their relevant supporting workpapers relating to the applicable EBITDA Calculation.
Unless the Buyer delivers written notice to Fellon and McCord on or prior to the 30th
calendar day after the receipt by it of the EBITDA Calculation, stating that the Buyer has
MD_DOCS_A #1137583 v8 9
objections to the EBITDA Calculation and describing in reasonable detail any such
objections, the Buyer shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed to the EBITDA
Calculation and shall pay the Performance Payment within 10 calendar days after such 30
day review period. If, on or prior to the 30th calendar day after the delivery of the
EBITDA Calculation, the Buyer shall give such notice to Fellon and McCord, the Buyer
and Fellon and McCord shall, within ten calendar days (or such longer period as such
Parties may agree) following the giving of such notice (the "Resolution Period"), attempt
in good faith to resolve any objections by the Buyer, and any resolution by them as to any
disputed amounts shall be final, binding and conclusive. In such case, Buyer shall pay
the undisputed portion of the Performance Payment within 10 calendar days after such
Resolution Period. Any amounts remaining in dispute at the conclusion of the Resolution
Period ("Unresolved Changes") shall be submitted to an accounting firm mutually
acceptable to the Parties (such firm being referred to as the "Auditing Firm"), within ten
calendar days after the expiration of the Resolution Period. In the event that the Buyer
and Fellon and McCord cannot agree on a mutually acceptable accounting firm, then the
Buyer shall select an accounting firm and Fellon and McCord shall, collectively, select an
accounting firm, and the two accounting firms shall together select a third independent
accounting firm to serve as the Auditing Firm. Each Party agrees to execute, if requested
by the Auditing Firm, an engagement letter containing reasonable terms. All fees and
expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Auditing Firm in accordance
with this Section 2(d) shall be borne equally by Fellon and McCord, on the one hand, and
the Buyer, on the other. The Auditing Firm shall be instructed not to apply any
materiality standard in making its determination and shall endeavor to provide the most
accurate answer attainable without incurring expense that is unreasonable, in light of the
amount in issue. The Auditing Firm shall be instructed to make such determination in
accordance with this Agreement. The Auditing Firm's determination of the Unresolved
Changes shall be made within 30 calendar days of the submission of the Unresolved
Changes thereto, shall be set forth in a written statement delivered to the Buyer and
Fellon and McCord and shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Parties for all
purposes. The Buyer shall pay any remaining Performance Payment within 10 calendar
days of the Auditing Firm’s determination of Unresolved Changes.
(e) The Closing. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the
"Closing”) shall take place at the offices of Stites & Harbison, 400 West Market Street,
Louisville, Kentucky 40202 commencing at 9:00 a.m. local time on the last business day of the

consummate the transactions contemplated hereby have occurred or been waived (other than
conditions with respect to actions the respective Parties will take at the Closing itself) or such
other date as the Buyer and the Sellers may mutually determine (the “Closing Date”).

method used to determine the net asset value threshold in Section 5(c) below. In the event that
the tangible net asset value on the combined FMA and AES balance sheets is less than negative
$597,000 at Closing, Conoco, Fellon and McCord shall each contribute his or its proportionate
share of such deficit to AES and FMA. In the event that the tangible net asset value on the
combined FMA and AES balance sheets is more than negative $597,000 at Closing (determined

CORPORATE REORGANIZATION AS CORPORATE REINVENTION:
BORDERS AND BLOCKBUSTER IN CHAPTER 11
Ruth Sarah Lee
*
At its heart, Chapter 11 is supposed to be about giving struggling businesses a new
beginning, predicated on the idea that „„a failing business can be reshaped into a successful
operation . . . a predictable creation from a people whose majority religion embraces the idea
of life from death and whose central myth is the pioneer making a fresh start on the boundless
prairie.‟‟1 However, major Chapter 11 cases filed in the past few months, and the subsequent
discussions they provoked, raise a new question to peruse: how new should the new beginning
be—how fresh the fresh start? When a corporation vows to change its business model in order to
pay back its debts and become more successful, how much is it supposed to change? Can it
morph into a completely different corporation after it emerges? Corporations like Borders Group,
Inc. (“Borders”) or Blockbuster Inc. (“Blockbuster”) might be making Chapter 11 the
fashionable, new way to metamorphose.
As far as large corporations are concerned, Chapter 11 should be about capturing, retaining,
and protecting something that is of value. If a corporation has nothing of worth that can be
preserved through reorganization, there are very few reasons why it should not be liquidated
immediately, its parts dissembled and auctioned, whatever lifeblood leftover to be given to its
creditors. All reorganization efforts “proceed in the shadow of the [liquidation]
alternative…[r]eorganizations are designed and evaluated by comparison with the outcomes
available” under liquidation.2 What this means is that some corporations should file for Chapter
11 bankruptcy, while others should liquidate, depending on what they have to offer.
In practice, however, Congress created powerful incentives for all corporations to choose
Chapter 11 in the past three decades.3 Among these incentives are strong presumptions in favor

of letting the debtor stay in control and the elimination of the insolvency requirement.4 Related to
this, legal academics have criticized reorganization procedures, regarding the system to be
corrupt, due to forum-shopping, judicial irresponsibility, and competition.5 But, these forces that
guide corporations toward corruption are also steering companies into a new sort of reinvention
bankruptcy—that is, a corporation that is popularly agreed to be not-viable nonetheless files for
Chapter 11 with hopes of not only refinancing, re-designing, or changing its business model—by
changing the entire business itself.
In reorganization, corporations need to have their reorganization plans confirmed by the
bankruptcy judge, who, in turn needs to ascertain, inter alia, that confirmation “is not likely to be
followed by the liquidation, or the need for further financial reorganization, of the debtor or any successor to the
debtor under the plan, unless such liquidation or reorganization is proposed in the plan.‟‟6 As a result, at least
theoretically, corporations should come up with plans that sound at least potentially successful. Blockbuster,
which recently put itself up for sale when its reorganization plan collapsed, 7 can hardly be mentioned without an
obligatory nod to Netflix and Redbox, both often credited with putting Blockbuster out of business, and both
often cited as reasons why Blockbuster should have just liquidated instead of putting up a fight. 8 Netflix and
Redbox are Blockbuster‟s more digital age savvy competitors, famous for cheaper by-mail and vending-kiosk
movie rentals, respectively. But now, Blockbuster is planning on „„closing old-fashioned stores, installing new
kiosks, and diving into digital delivery.‟‟9 In other words, Blockbuster is trying to turn into Netflix.
Observers have noted similarities between Blockbuster‟s Chapter 11 and Borders‟ Chapter
11.10 Both are companies victimized by the digitalization of media and burdened with chains of
large physical stores.11 Borders‟ bankruptcy has been attributed to “its failure to establish a
provisions of Chapter 11 affording the corporate debtor considerable latitude regarding its treatment of creditors,
effectively gave managers powerful incentives to pursue bankruptcy reorganization.‟‟).

strong online sales operation and a slow embrace of electronic books.”12 Like Blockbuster,
Borders is playing the chameleon by changing its identity: shifting “the focus away from its
physical presence” and at the same time “overhaul[ing] its website and introduc[ing] a digital
book store.”13
Borders and Blockbuster are merely two examples of companies that seem somewhat
antiquated to the electronic generation. And as they flounder around in Chapter 11, they both
have their eyes on becoming digitized, unrecognizable from their former selves. It is one thing to
do a balance-sheet reorganization, refinance, close unprofitable chain stores, and rethink a
business model, but it is another thing entirely to turn yourself from a video rental store into an
online streaming service; or from a physical bookstore into Amazon.com. Yet this is what these
corporations are considering.
In one sense, this is the same old story we have all heard before, that a bankrupt corporation
must find new ways to make profits. However, practically speaking, this means that the 11
U.S.C. § 1129 hurdle should be relatively easy to clear as long as a corporation is flexible
enough about its future. Any out-of-date corporation can turn around, point its finger at a more
successful, technologically fashionable company and say, “I am going to be like that!” It is true
that a judge might be skeptical about the ability of the corporation to change, especially in light
of its debts, but Blockbuster is an example that is very established in its ways, with almost $1
billion in debt at the time of filing.14
Furthermore, this is actually a radical shift in the essence of reorganizational bankruptcy: We
are no longer considering a corporation that has any worth to preserve at the beginning of the
reorganization, we are considering a corporation that wants to create worth by reinventing
itself.15 We are no longer dealing with a viable business that has fallen on hard times and needs
some tweaking; we are dealing with businesses that are so admittedly unviable that they need to
transform into a completely different business in order to convince the bankruptcy judges that
they have a fighting chance at life.
Borders is transforming into Amazon.com. Blockbusters is transforming into Netflix. What is
Chapter 11 reorganization transforming into? Perhaps—rebirth.

15 An argument that could be made is that the brand name itself (Borders or Blockbuster) is value worth
preserving through Chapter 11, even if the companies themselves completely change into unrecognizably new
companies. However, this departs from most of the traditional Chapter 11 discussions (which are mainly about
preserving assets and jobs).

Introduction
1. Background
1.1. Legal Legends has been requested by herein after referred to as (the “Acquirer”) to undertake a legal due diligence investigation of
the business and affairs of ( ” or the “Target”) (the "Investigation").
1.2. The principal aim of the Investigation is to identify any potential or contingent legal risk associated with the Target which may have an impact on the
negotiation, structuring and implementation of the proposed acquisition of 100% of the members interest in the Target by the Acquirer (the “Proposed
Transaction”).
1.3. The scope of the Investigation is limited to the information made available to Legal Legends for the purpose of disclosing confidential information to
the Acquirers and their advisors.
2. Format of this due diligence report ("Report")
This document is divided into four sections:
2.1. this introductory section, including the status of this report and Legal Legends assumptions in preparing this Report;
2.2. the definitions used in this Report;
2.3. the red flag issues report, with key issues and suggestions going forward relevant to the Proposed Transaction; and
2.4. the key issues list, being an executive summary of the material issues described in the Report.
3. Status of this report
3.1. This Report sets out the results of the Investigation and the review performed by Legal Legends in the period from in relation to the various documents
furnished to and reviewed by Legal Legends.
3.2. This Report sets out only those findings which in the professional discretion and opinion of Legal Legends are material issues which have a bearing
on either the implementation of the Proposed Transaction or which would have a material influence on the Acquirers’ decision whether or not to
proceed with the implementation of the Proposed Transaction. In the circumstances, the potential for undisclosed documents, arrangements and
agreements which may constitute a risk for the Acquirers in relation to the Proposed Transaction does exist.
3.3. This Report pertains only to the legal aspects of the documentation provided to us and we have not reviewed or commented on any commercial,
financial, scientific or technical aspects.
3.4. As such, Legal Legends sought to isolate, through the Investigation and based on the documentation provided, those material issues relating to the
Target of which the Acquirers should be aware in order to determine whether the Proposed Transaction should occur.
3.5. This Report is to be considered as part of the overall process of due diligence being undertaken by and on behalf of the Acquirers in relation to the
Target and the Proposed Transaction and is not to be taken in isolation. We do not accept responsibility for assessing the commercial or technical
implications of the documents or information reviewed by us (as such a review would require, among other things commercial and industry knowledge
and expertise as well as a full understanding of the Acquirers’ commercial plans), although we have sought, where possible, to highlight matters which
we consider, in our professional discretion and opinion, to be commercially significant. Accordingly, this review should not be seen as a substitute for
examination of appropriate documents and materials by commercial and technical personnel and advisors.
3.6. This Report does not contain a detailed description of each document reviewed and its purpose is to set out those material legal issues which we
consider, in our professional discretion and opinion, to be material in the context of the Proposed Transaction. Reliance should not be placed solely
on any of the summaries contained in this Report, which are not intended to be exhaustive of the provisions of any document or circumstances. It is
important to note that the Investigation does not consist of a full and comprehensive due diligence investigation.
3.7. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by us in writing, no person other than the Acquirers is entitled to rely on this Report, and we shall have no
responsibility or liability to any party who has access to this Report, whether in contract, delict (including negligence) or otherwise.
3.8. It is recorded that this Report is strictly confidential and may not be released to any person who has not signed the appropriate release letter in favour
of Legal Legends.
4. Scope of the Investigation
4.1. The Target was furnished with a due diligence data questionnaire setting out those documents and information which Legal Legends required for
consideration in the Investigation.
4.2. Documentation was made available via email.
4.3. In accordance with our instructions, any financial, accounting, auditing and tax issues were specifically excluded from the scope of our review.

available; and
5.8. except where expressly stated by us to the contrary all transfer duties and/or similar duties, taxes or levies relating to the documents and the
transactions contemplated therein have been paid in full on the due date.
6. Disclaimer
6.1. This Report is addressed to the Acquirers solely for its use and benefit and may not be transmitted to any other person without our prior written
consent, except in those instances where the Acquirers may be obliged by law to do so.
