correct and not necessarily exact, but are intended to be reasonably accurate.
e. While the Parties have made a good faith effort to list all of their separate
property assets and liabilities, the Parties agree that any omission of an item does not
preclude a Party from later claiming its separate property characterization. The Parties have
tried to use the correct legal description for each asset listed in any schedule attached to this
agreement. If any asset is incorrectly described, the description used is adequate for the
purposes of this agreement and accompanying schedules, and the Parties agree to execute
any additional paperwork required to confirm ownership in the name of the Party in whose
schedule the asset appears.

2.05 Agreement Conditioned on Marriage.
a. The property owned by the Parties, as disclosed above, is listed for disclosure
purposes, only, and the listing of such property is not regarded by either Party as an
inducement to enter into this Agreement or the marriage. The Parties agree that the property
listed above and all increases in value of all such property (including but not limited to
increases resulting from the time, talents, efforts and labor of either or both of them) shall
remain the separate property of the Party owning it. The Parties agree that they will use their
best efforts to keep the property of the Parties as separate property by any means necessary,
including not commingling it with community or marital property. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any commingling of such property shall not be deemed a waiver of the separate
ownership of such property, except as may be specifically provided below in Section 3.16.
b. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, to the extent that
either has or would have in the future any rights, whether legal or equitable, in relation to
the separate property of the other (including but not limited to increases in its value and the
income it produces), those rights are specifically waived and released to the Party owning
the property. The omission of any property or debt from either schedule is inadvertent and,
for all purposes of this Agreement, any property or debt omitted is deemed to be included.
The Parties agree that each of them shall retain full possession, control, and management of
his or her separate property.
c. The Parties enter into this Agreement in consideration of marriage. The
effectiveness of this Agreement is expressly conditioned on the occurrence of such marriage.
This agreement is void following its execution if the Parties are not married within ninety
days.
2.06 JOHN DOE admits and acknowledges that each Party has been represented by independent
legal counsel in the negotiation of this Agreement. JOHN DOE, further acknowledges that he
freely chose J. MARK EDGMON of Granstaff, Gaedke & Edgmon, PC to act as his own legal
counsel, that he has read this Agreement, and that his counsel has explained to him the meaning and
legal consequences of the Agreement, and that he fully understands the Agreement.
2.07 JANE DOE admits and acknowledges that each Party has been represented by independent
legal counsel in the negotiation of this Agreement. JANE DOE further acknowledges that she
freely chose DUEY CHEETUM to act as her own legal counsel, and that she has read this
Agreement, and that her counsel has explained to her the meaning and legal consequences of the
Agreement, and that she fully understands the Agreement.

ARTICLE III. AGREEMENTS:
3.01 Separate Property to Remain Separate Property. All separate property of a respective Party
existing at the date of the marriage between the Parties, and all appreciation and increments thereon
occurring after the marriage date, shall be and constitute the separate property and estate of such
respective Party.
3.02 Separate Liability To Remain Separate Liability. All separate liabilities of a respective Party
existing at the date of the marriage between the Parties, make payments on separate property,
operate separate property, or improve, maintain, or repair separate property, shall be and constitute
the separate liability and separate obligation of such respective Party. The Parties agree that only
the respective Party’s separate property shall be subject to satisfaction of such separate liabilities
of the respective Party.
3.03 Income from Separate Property To Constitute Separate Property. All income, including, but
not limited to, interest, rents, dividends, stock splits, salary, trust distributions, permutations,
increases or benefits, bonuses, or other distributions or increases in value of any kind or nature,
which is derived from the separate property of either Party shall be and constitute the separate
property of the respective Party who owns the property producing such income.
3.04 Earnings of JOHN DOE and JANE DOE To Constitute Separate Property. All Personal
Service Earnings or incomes which are the product of JOHN DOE’s or JANE DOE’s labor,
employment, or occupation will constitute the separate property of the Party to whom such earnings
or incomes are paid. As used in this Premarital Agreement, “Personal Service Earnings” shall be
broadly construed to mean all money, property, and benefits received by a Party as a result of their
personal services, time, toil, and effort, and shall include, by way of example but not limitation,
wages, salary, bonuses, retirement benefits, expense allowances, expense reimbursements, payment
of expenses, commissions of any and all kinds and vacations.
3.05 Contributions to Retirement Accounts. All contributions, including, but not limited to,
interest, employee contributions, employer contributions, paycheck deductions, deposits,
permutations, increases or benefits, bonuses, or other distributions or increases in value of any kind
or nature to any type of retirement account, including, but not limited to, individual retirement
accounts, 401(k) plans, profit sharing plans, pension plans, self employed pension, Keogh, whether
occurring before, on or after the marriage date shall be and constitute the separate property of the
participant or owner of such retirement account.
3.06 Confirmation of Separate Property. In no way limiting the foregoing, the following property
will remain the separate property of the Party who owns the separate property:
a. Property that is traceable to separate property owned before marriage;
b. Property that is acquired during the marriage from separate funds;
_________________________________________
Prenuptial Agreement - Page 5
c. Property that is received in exchange for separate property;
d. Property that is purchased with proceeds of sale of separate property;
e. All increases of, including but not limited to increases resulting from the time,
talents, efforts and labor of either or both of them, and income from, separate property;
f. All earnings, compensation, distributions, and income of every type from the
listed assets attached as Exhibits A and B received by a Party prior to or during the marriage;
and
g. All other property of every type whatsoever received or acquired by a Party
during the marriage, except as provided for in Section 3.16 regarding ownership of joint
bank accounts and other jointly purchased property.
3.07 Credit Obligations. Unless otherwise specifically agreed in writing by the Parties at any
time, all contract or credit obligations of either Party existing prior to the marriage and those
incurred by either of them alone after the marriage shall be separate obligations of that Party payable
out of his or her funds. Any property purchased through the use of credit, will be the separate
property of the Party in whose name title is taken, or if there is no evidence of title, such property
will be the separate property of the Party making the credit transaction. Unless otherwise agreed
in writing by the Parties at any time, the separate property of a Party existing at any time after the
marriage (whether or not acquired before the marriage) shall not be liable in any way for the separate
contract or credit obligations of the other Party, including but not limited to those that were in
existence before the marriage (including those obligations that are renewed, extended, or
renegotiated after the marriage).
3.08 New Credit Obligations. The Parties agree that each of them may enter into new credit
transactions or extend, renew, or renegotiate credit existing prior to the marriage without the express
approval or joinder of the other Party. If either Party, without the joinder of the other Party, enters
into a transaction (or acts with respect to a transaction or any credit existing prior to the marriage)
where credit is extended to (or renewed for) him or her or if he or she becomes liable or obligated
for the repayment (contingent or otherwise) of credit extended by a third Party, then those liabilities
or obligations (including penalties, interest, costs, attorney's fees, or other charges relating to them)
shall be satisfied entirely from his or her separate property. In that connection, the Parties agree to
advise interested third Parties that any liability or obligation of that nature is not a community or
marital liability or obligation and is his or her separate property liability or obligation. The Parties
further agree to cause any documentation relating to those transactions to clearly reflect the separate
character of the obligation or liability. In consideration of that Agreement, the Parties agree that the
assets, if any, acquired without the other Party's express approval or joinder in the transaction shall
be the separate property of the Party obligating his or her separate property in the transaction, unless
the Parties agree otherwise in writing at the time the credit is extended.
_________________________________________
Prenuptial Agreement - Page 6
3.09 Judicial Determination of Joint Debt. The Parties agree that in the event a creditor shall
judicially establish joint liability for a debt incurred by one spouse, the spouse incurring the liability
agrees to reimburse the other spouse in the amount of such liability if paid by the spouse not
incurring the debt.
3.10 Indemnification. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each
Party agrees to indemnify and hold the other Party harmless of and from any and all claims, loss,
damage, and expense (including, but not limited to, court costs and attorneys' fees) arising as a result
of or in connection with (i) any act or failure to act of the indemnifying Party which occurred prior
to the marriage or any contract, credit arrangement, or other Agreement which the indemnifying
Party entered into prior to the marriage; (ii) any act or failure to act of the indemnifying Party which
occurred following the marriage unless the other Party participated in the act or omission; and (iii)
any contract, credit arrangement, or other Agreement which the indemnifying Party entered into
after the marriage unless the other Party expressly consented in writing to be bound by the contract
or Agreement.
3.11 Agreement to Partition Property. The Parties agree that all property they may acquire during
their marriage when traceable to the listed assets on Exhibits A and B, which property would
otherwise have been community property by operation of Texas law, or marital property subject to
equitable division under the law of any other state, will be partitioned automatically by operation
of this agreement into separate estates, except for jointly purchased assets as described in Paragraph
3.16 below. The property will be partitioned to the Party who earned it, or to the Party whose
separate property funds contributed to its acquisition.
3.12 Agreement Regarding Income From Separate Property. The Parties agree that all of the
income, increase in value, or property derived from all of each Party's separate property will be the
separate property of the owner-spouse. This provision applies to the separate property the Parties
own prior to marriage and to separate property that may be acquired during the marriage.
3.13 Payments and Improvements on Separate Property. The Parties agree that if either Party uses
his or her own separate funds to make any payment toward the purchase of the other Party's separate
property, or either Party uses any funds which he or she has any interest in to make a payment
toward the purchase of the separate property of the other Party, the property so paid for will remain
entirely the separate property of the owner-spouse. The Party making such payment using his or
her separate property will not be entitled to reimbursement. Such payments will be considered
entirely a gift to the owner of the separate property.
3.14 Improvements to Separate Property. The Parties agree that if either Party uses his or her own
separate funds to make any improvement on or to the other Party's separate property, or either Party
uses funds in which he or she has any interest to make any improvement on the separate property
of the other Party, the property so improved will remain entirely the separate property of the owner-
spouse. The Party making such improvement using his or her separate property will not be entitled
_________________________________________
Prenuptial Agreement - Page 7
to reimbursement. Such payments will be considered entirely a gift to the owner of the separate
property.
3.15 No Intention To Create Community Property. The following events may not, under any
circumstances, be considered evidence of any intention to create community property, but are not
intended as an exclusive list:
a. the filing of joint tax returns;
b. the taking of title to property, whether real or personal, in joint tenancy or in
any other joint or common form;
c. the designation of one Party by the other Party as a beneficiary of his or her
estate or as trustee or any other form of fiduciary;
d. the combining or mixing by one Party of his or her separate funds or property
with the separate funds or property of the other Party, including the pledging of joint or
separate credit for the benefit of the other Party's separate estate;
e. any oral statement by either Party;
f. any written statement by either Party, other than a written agreement that
contains an explicit statement of the Party's intent to change the Party's separately owned
property into community property;
g. the payment from the funds of either Party for any obligations, including but
not limited to the payment of mortgages, interest, real property taxes, repairs, or
improvements on a separately or jointly held residence; and
h. the joint occupation of a separately owned residence, even though designated
as a homestead.
3.16 Joint Accounts and Other Jointly Purchased Properties.
a. Joint Property. The Parties hereby agree that during marriage, they may from
time to time, by mutual agreement, have the opportunity to acquire jointly owned property,
either as jointly owned separate property or as community property. The Parties hereby
agree that if property is acquired by both Parties’ credit and is taken in the names of both
Parties, and if both Parties sign their names to the document creating the liability, the Parties
shall own such property as community property, unless they both declare in writing that they
are holding the property as separate property, in which event any such property will be
owned by each Party equally as equal separate property.
_________________________________________
Prenuptial Agreement - Page 8
b. Joint Accounts. It is anticipated that during the marriage the Parties may
create one or more accounts in financial institutions in joint names in which they may put
Personal Service Earnings and for which either Party will have the right to withdraw for
ordinary and customary living expenses. The Parties hereby agree that any funds in this
account will be owned as community property.
c. Personal Items. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, it is agreed
that all personal clothing, jewelry, sporting goods, and items of adornment will be the
separate property of the person who ordinarily uses or enjoys such property without regard
to the source of the funds used to acquire such property.
3.17 Mutual Release of Marital Rights. Both Parties mutually agree that each Party waives,
discharges, and releases any and all claims and rights, actual or contingent, that he or she may
acquire in the separate property of the other by reason of their marriage. The waiver of interest in
the other Party's separate property includes any and all claims or rights either Party would have
under Texas law or the law of any other State, as a result of dissolution of the marriage, by the death
of one of the Parties, or divorce. The provisions of this agreement are not intended to adversely
affect the right of any child of this marriage to child support. The claims and rights that are hereby
waived and released include but are not limited to the following:
a. The right to a family allowance;
b. The rights or claims of dower, curtesy, or any statutory substitutes
therefor as provided by the statutes of the state in which the Parties, or either of
them, may die domiciled or in which they may own real property;
c. The right of election to take against the Will of the other;
d. The right to a distributive share in the estate of the other should he or
she die intestate;
e. The right to act as administrator of the estate of the other;
f. The right to any form of spousal maintenance or alimony, during or following
the dissolution of this marriage; and
g. The right to act as guardian of the estate and/or person of the other unless
designated as guardian pursuant to the Texas Probate Code.
3.18 Property Management. JOHN DOE, will have sole and exclusive management of his
separate property. JANE DOE will have sole and exclusive management of her separate property.
Each Party reserves the right to dispose of his or her respective separate property by any method,
including by gift, will or other testamentary instrument, and reserves the right to sell, mortgage, or
_________________________________________
Prenuptial Agreement - Page 9
otherwise deal with his or her separate property without consulting the non-managing spouse.
Neither Party is obligated to give, devise, bequeath, transfer or convey his or her property, whether
separate, community, or marital, to or for the benefit of the other Party or his or her children.
3.19 Agreement to Join in Execution of Other Instruments. Both Parties to this Agreement
covenant and agree that they will willingly, at the request of the other Party, or at the request of his
or her successors or assigns, execute, deliver and properly acknowledge whatever additional
instruments may be required to carry out the intention of this Agreement, and will execute, deliver
and properly acknowledge any deeds or other documents necessary to effectuate this Agreement.
3.20 Invalid Provisions. The Parties agree that if any portion of this Agreement is held invalid
or unenforceable for any reason, the remainder of the Agreement will remain in full force and effect.
3.21 Term of Agreement. This Agreement will terminate when the marriage terminates, whether
by divorce, annulment or death. The Parties reserve the right to terminate this Agreement by mutual
written Agreement.
3.22 Division of Property in Event of Divorce. The Parties that, although Texas courts are
required to divide the property of divorcing couples in a manner they deem just and fair, if they own
no community property at the time of divorce, there will be no property for the court to divide, and
thus neither Party will be entitled to receive any property as a result of a court-ordered division of
their estates. In the event that the marriage of JANE DOE and JOHN DOE is dissolved by divorce,
the Parties hereby agree that each Party shall receive (a) all separate property belonging to that
Party; (b) all income, revenue, or property from separate property; and ( c ) one-half of all
community assets, if any.
3.23 Wife's Surname. JANE DOE reserves the right during the marriage to retain the use of her
surname, "DOE” for any or all purposes as she in her absolute and unfettered discretion may
determine.
3.24 Gifts Between Parties. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall preclude one Party from
receiving an inter vivos or testamentary gift of any property from the other Party.
3.25 Income Taxes. The Parties agree that they will each pay their respective federal (and state,
if applicable) income tax liability based upon the income of the Parties hereto. Any such income
tax liability shall be shared by the Parties in the ratio of the aggregate taxable income of each such
Party to the total taxable income reflected in such tax return times the total income tax liability. In
this fashion, such income tax liability will be paid, respectively, by the community estate, if any, by
the separate estate of JOHN DOE and by the separate estate of JANE DOE on a pro rata basis.
JOHN DOE and JANE DOE shall agree upon an equitable apportionment of such tax liabilities
where their respective incomes have varying characteristics.
_________________________________________
Prenuptial Agreement - Page 10
3.26 Binding Effect. This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of the respective heirs,
personal representatives, successors, and assigns of the Parties.
3.27 Entire Agreement: Modification. This Agreement contains the entire Agreement between
the Parties. Any oral representations of modifications made before or after the execution of this
Agreement will be of no force or effect, provided, however, that the Parties expressly reserve the
right to amend (in form or in substance) or terminate this Agreement at any time by the execution
by both Parties of a written instrument acknowledged before a Notary Public for that purpose. Such
written Agreement must specifically refer to this Agreement. The waiver by a Party of any breach
of any provision of this Agreement by the other Party shall not invalidate this Agreement or any
provision of it, (including the provision breached).
3.28 Miscellaneous. This Agreement:
a. shall remain in force and in effect unless and until it is altered or amended in
accordance with the foregoing provisions;
b. shall be governed by the laws of the State of Texas;
c. is enforceable in Texas or any other State the Parties may be domiciled in;
d. is binding on the Parties and their respective heirs, personal representatives,
successors, and assigns; and
e. represents the entirety of the Agreement of the Parties as to the subject matter
and there exist no other understandings, representations, or warranties, express or implied,
oral or written, relative to its subject matter as of the date of its execution.
3.29 Tort Liability. All tort liability of a Party arising prior to or after the marriage shall be
enforceable against and discharged from the separate property of that Party only, and not from the
separate property of the other Party.
3.30 Waiver. Each Party acknowledges that by executing this Agreement, he or she may be
permanently surrendering rights and claims he or she may have under Texas law governing marital
property. Each of them acknowledges that he or she is entering into this Agreement voluntarily.
3.31 Place of Residence. The Parties, at the time of entering into this Agreement, intend to reside
together during their marriage in the State of Texas. The Parties acknowledge that this agreement
is to be fully binding and enforceable in Texas, as well as anywhere else they may live, and Texas
law will govern this agreement in any court, regardless of where said court is located.
_________________________________________
Prenuptial Agreement - Page 11
3.32 Confidentiality. The Parties agree that this Agreement (including its Schedules) is privileged
and confidential. This Agreement shall not be disclosed to any third Party or be used for any
purposes by the Parties or their attorneys, except in connection with the enforcement of the
Agreement.
3.33 Ratification. The Parties agree that, not later than thirty days after their marriage, they will
each execute two (2) original counterparts of the Ratification of Prenuptial Agreement (the
"Ratification Agreement"), a copy of which is attached to this agreement as Exhibit “C”. The Parties
agree that, to the maximum extent allowed by law, the failure to execute the Ratification Agreement
will not invalidate this agreement or affect any of its terms or provisions. Whether the Ratification
Agreement is executed or not, all the provisions of this agreement are binding, including but not
limited to the effect of causing the income from the separate property of JANE DOE to be JANE
DOE's separate property and the income from the separate property of JOHN DOE to be JOHN
DOE's separate property.
3.34 Mediation/Arbitration.
a. It is the intent of the Parties that any conflict or controversy that may arise regarding
this agreement, its interpretation, or its application should be resolved amicably by the Parties and
without the necessity of court intervention. In furtherance of such desire, the Parties agree that in
the event any conflict or controversy arises, the matter will promptly be submitted to mediation by
the Party opposing the requested interpretation or application notifying the mediator of the
controversy or conflict and requesting that the mediator schedule a date for mediation. The mediator
will be selected by agreement of the Parties, or if failing agreement, by court appointment.
b. In the event any Party files for dissolution of marriage or if any dispute or
controversy arises out of the interpretation, enforcement, and division of the estate of the Parties
under this Premarital Agreement and mediation does not resolve the dispute and controversy, the
Parties hereby agree to submit any such dispute or controversy to binding arbitration, and each Party
expressly waives any right to trial by a court or trial by a jury. This provision for binding arbitration
shall be in accordance with the provisions of the Texas Family Code § 6.601 and § 153.0071, if
applicable, and Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code § 171.001 et seq. or any successor statute
as may be enacted by the Texas Legislature. The Parties agree to appoint one arbitrator whose
decision shall be binding in all respects and whose ruling shall be the basis for division of the marital
estate of the Parties in the event of a divorce. Any arbitrator appointed by the Parties must be a
member in good standing with the state bar association in the state where the arbitration is
conducted. Should the Parties not be able to agree upon an arbitrator, each Party shall appoint a
person of the qualifications listed above, and those two persons shall confer upon the appointment
of a third arbitrator. The compensation of the arbitrator shall be paid as agreed upon by the Parties,
or in the event of a disagreement regarding the compensation of the arbitrator, the arbitrator shall
be compensated as the arbitrator rules.

NONMARITAL COHABITATION AGREEMENT
1. IDENTIFICATION OF PARTIES.
This Agreement is made between MARK SMITH, hereafter referred to as “Mark,” and
AUDREY JONES, hereafter referred to as “Audrey.”
2. PARTIES’ CIRCUMSTANCES.
The parties intend to begin residing together effective May 15, 2012, together with
Audrey’s daughter, Sally Strong. They have never previously resided together, and
have never previously accumulated any assets or shared any income together. They
do not presently contemplate marriage.
a) Mark is 56 years of age and Audrey is 37 years of age. Mark is a retired
executive formerly employed by Hilton Corporation in New York, New York, and is
currently unemployed. He is presently married to Kelly Smith but a dissolution is
pending between he and Kelly in the State of Florida with the expectation it will be
finalized in June, 2012. Pursuant to that proceeding, certain assets will be awarded to
him by settlement or otherwise. Mark has no children by any prior relation. Upon the
finalization of his divorce, he will own no real property. His net worth is in excess of
$500,000, and his income is derived from managing his investment portfolio. He has
no present plan to recommence employment. He is in excellent health, except for
injuries sustained in a surfing accident.
b) Audrey is a mother and homemaker. She is not presently employed and
has no present intention to become employed outside the home. She has a nominal
net worth. She was formerly married and is now divorced. A court order provides she is
to receive $300/monthly as and for child support from Sally’s father. She is in excellent
health.
c) Both parties are presently capable of self-support.
3. PURPOSES OF AGREEMENT.
a) The parties do not intend any of the marital status provisions of the
California Family Code to be applicable to any of their legal rights. As between the
parties, their rights of support and property ownership - including interests in real or
personal property that may be acquired by either of them whether individually or jointly,
and the right to share in any earnings or accumulations of the other party - shall be
governed exclusively by this Agreement.
b) The parties do not intend by this Agreement or by their cohabitation
arrangement to create a form of marriage recognized by this or any other state.
1[SAMPLE] Nonm arital Cohabitation Agreem ent: Sm ith & Jones __MS __AJ
c) The parties intend that this Agreement shall remain binding and in full
force and effect regardless of any future change in their residence or domicile, and that
it shall be terminated only as provided in this Agreement.
d) The purposes of this Agreement are to define the property rights, to
create no liability between them for debts of the other - whether as necessaries of life or
otherwise, and to provide for the financial arrangements, of the parties while they
continue to reside together and in the event either of them wishes to terminate their
cohabitation. Additionally, the parties wish to supercede and waive any claims or
defenses either of them might otherwise assert if their relationship was to end, except
as may be set forth herein or in a subsequent written Agreement between them. Such
claims without limitation include verbal or implied Agreements (and whether or not the
parties hold themselves out to third parties as a married couple or otherwise engage in
‘married-like’ behavior or conduct).
e) No joint venture, partnership, express or implied joint pooling Agreement
or arrangement relating to assets or liabilities, or support rights and obligations shall
result from the fact of their cohabitation, or from any of the parties’ activities, conduct,
or verbal or written representations (except subsequently executed modifications to this
Agreement) between them or to third parties during the period they continue to reside
together or thereafter. In addition, no de facto parent relationship will arise, or be
deemed to arise, between Mark and Maria. All future agreements between the parties
must be memorialized in a writing signed by them both.
4. DISCLOSURE OF ASSETS.
Mark has disclosed to Audrey that he has investment cash assets worth in excess of
$500,000. Mark owes no consumer or other debt. Audrey has disclosed to Mark that
she has minimal assets, and owes money on a student loan. Neither party requires any
further disclosure of assets and liabilities from the other and each is entirely
comfortable with the information set forth herein. This Agreement shall be fully
enforceable between the parties despite their decision to not list assets and debts
according to Exhibits that would otherwise be attached hereto.
5. NO CHANGE IN PROPERTY RIGHTS.
Except as otherwise stated in a subsequently executed Agreement, all assets of either
party acquired before the effective date of this Agreement are and shall remain the
property of that party. All assets acquired by either party on or after the effective date
of this Agreement shall likewise be the property of that party.
6. SEPARATE AND JOINT ACQUISITIONS.
If the parties decide to acquire a particular asset together, they shall contribute funds to
2[SAMPLE] Nonm arital Cohabitation Agreem ent MS___ AJ ___
that acquisition in accordance with the proportionate interests they are to hold and shall
take title to reflect those proportionate interests. If title is taken in the name of one party
alone it shall be conclusively presumed that it was the parties’ intention that only the
party in whose name title is or was taken or held has, had, or shall have an interest in
the property. For each joint acquisition of property, the parties shall execute a written
addendum or modification to this Agreement, specifying the property that is co-owned
by them and the terms of co-acquisition and co-ownership.
7. UNSECURED DEBT.
All joint debt shall be paid in the normal course with joint funds, and neither party shall
incur any debt beyond such sums are as are then held in the Household Account
described below. The parties shall not obtain credit cards in their joint names. It is
anticipated that a Debit Card will be issued on the Household Account described below
for either party’s use and each party will have complete discretion as to how those
monies are expended except that neither party will cause said account to be overdrawn.
Neither party is or shall be authorized to incur any debt in the name of the
other party, or on behalf of the other party, except as the parties may from time to time
expressly agree in a writing separate from any debt instrument which is signed by both
of them.
8. SEPARATE BANK ACCOUNTS/EARNINGS.
Hereafter either party may retain his or her own bank accounts, or open new accounts
in their name alone, but the parties agree that all such accounts shall be considered
separately owned by the party whose name appears on the account. If the parties
jointly open accounts in the names of both of them, all monies held in said accounts
shall be jointly owned between them provided that if either party utilizes said monies
neither will owe any reimbursements to the other.
Each party shall retain his or her own earnings and other funds in his or
her own individual savings, checking, or other account, for disposition at will, except for
funds needed for household expenses, as provided in the immediately succeeding
paragraph.
9. HOUSEHOLD ACCOUNT.
The parties shall maintain a joint checking account as joint tenants for household
expenses such as rent, food, household supplies, utilities, and Audrey’s reasonable
personal expenses. Audrey will have no obligation to contribute to said account, and all
funds which Mark contributes to said account shall become the joint property of the
parties provided, however, that if said account is subsequently used to make mortgage
payments on any property, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
3[SAMPLE] Nonm arital Cohabitation Agreem ent MS___ AJ ___
Audrey will not acquire any interest in the ownership of said property by reason of said
payments thereon whether for interest or principal. Further, neither party shall cause
said account to become overdrawn or otherwise issue drafts or charges in excess of the
balance of said account at any particular point in time.
10. NO OBLIGATION OF SUPPORT.
Neither party shall have any obligation to support the other party, either during the
relationship or in the event that the relationship terminates, for any period after
termination of the Agreement or the cohabitation, regardless of the reasons for the
termination. In no event shall any obligation for palimony or support arise between the
parties at any time.
11. GIFTS AND INHERITANCES.
a) Neither party has any right to succeed to or inherit from the estate of the
other after the death of the other except by a valid will or trust drawn by the respective
party after the date of this Agreement. Naming the other party as beneficiary in a will or
trust executed after the date of this Agreement shall not imply or include any agreement
that the other party has a vest property interest in and to the will or trust or property
referenced therein; such a right may only arise by joint, or joint and mutual, or mutual
wills. The fact that one party might execute a will or trust and the other party might not
is agreed to be within the parties’ contemplation at this time.
b) If either party makes a gift of real or personal property to the other, in the
event their cohabitation terminates then that gift shall remain the sole and separate
property of the party to whom the gift is made; provided, however, that any gift made
between the parties valued in excess of $5,000 at the time of the gift shall be identified
as a gift in a writing signed by the party to be charged.
c) If either party receives a gift or inheritance from relatives or third parties,
those funds or property shall be and shall remain the sole property of the person
receiving said gift or inheritance unless and until the parties jointly execute a separate
addendum or writing which clearly sets forth that the receiving party intends to make a
gift of some interest in said funds or property to the other party.
12. NO FIDUCIARY DUTIES.
No confidential or fiduciary relationship shall arise, or be deemed to arise, by reason of
this Agreement or the fact of cohabitation and to the greatest extent possibly under the
law, the parties waive the creation of fiduciary duties as between them provided,
however, that if the parties acquire real or personal property together in joint names,
then such fiduciary obligations as arise by operation of law as a consequence thereof
shall remain in effect.
4[SAMPLE] Nonm arital Cohabitation Agreem ent MS___ AJ ___
13. SUBSEQUENT MARRIAGE.
This Agreement shall terminate upon the marriage of the parties to each other, or upon
either party’s marriage or domestic partnership to any other person, and any property
then held jointly or separately by them shall continue to be held as a separate property
interest of each for purposes of the property laws of the State of California.
In addition, if the parties subsequently have children together that fact will not
expand the obligations and limitations of this Agreement except as otherwise provided
by California law relating to child custody and child support.
14. CONSIDERATION FOR AGREEMENT.
The consideration for this Agreement is the mutual promises of the parties. Audrey
agrees to provide services for Mark as a companion, cook, housekeeper, and
homemaker. In addition, on or before July 1, 2012, Mark shall gift the sum of $5,000
which she may deposit into her own account as she pleases. If Mark makes future gifts
to Audrey of cash or property, such gifts will not create an ongoing right in Audrey to
receive further such gifts. Neither party is being asked or required to abandon any
education, employment, or career to enter into this cohabitation. The furnishing of
sexual services forms no part of the consideration for the Agreement.
In addition to the foregoing consideration for this agreement, including the provision for
a waiver of any legal or equitable claims for support that might otherwise accrue to
Audrey, the parties agree that if either party hereafter terminates this agreement for any
reason other than a marriage between them, and within fifteen days after Audrey
moves from any residence where the parties are then residing, Mark will pay to her a
sum equal to $1,000/month multiplied by the number of months that the parties have
resided together from and after May 15, 2012, to the date of termination hereof, in a
single lump sum, provided that concurrent with said payment Audrey may first be
required by Mark to execute a further Mutual Release Agreement including waivers of
any and all claims hereafter arising between the parties, and a waiver of California Civil
Code section 1542, which provides as follows:
A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does
not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the
Release, which if known by him must have materially affected his
settlement with the debtor.
The Mutual Release Agreement shall also provide for the division of any personal or
other property jointly owned by the parties. If for any reason the parties are in
disagreement about this division, they agree to undertake a mediation or arbitration
process as they then decide solely related to the issue of property division, and the
5[SAMPLE] Nonm arital Cohabitation Agreem ent MS___ AJ ___
payment provided for hereunder shall not be due until all issues between the parties
have been settled or resolved between them.
In the event this Agreement is terminated because of a marriage, there shall be no
requirement for Mark to pay any sums hereunder, although Audrey will retain all monies
which she has actually received to that point, and there will be no requirement for the
execution of a Mutual Release Agreement except as may be set forth in a new or
supplementary written Agreement between the parties.
15. EXECUTION OF DOCUMENTS.
Each party shall execute, acknowledge, and deliver whatever additional documents or
instruments may be necessary or appropriate to accomplish the purposes of this
Agreement, including, but not limited to, title papers, deeds, or other documents usually
executed in connection with real property transactions or to evidence the separate or
jointly-owned nature of real property.
16. TERMINATION OF COHABITATION.
The parties may separate at any time by mutual understanding or by the election of
either party acting alone. If the decision to separate is made by Mark’s election, or by
the parties jointly, Audrey will vacate the premises at 54950 Avenida Anywhere, La
Quinta, California, or any other residence then jointly occupied by the parties and
owned by Mark as his sole and separate property or rented by him in his name alone,
within 30 days afer the parties’ separation. If the then-jointly occupied residence is
owned by Audrey as her sole and separate property or rented by her in her name alone,
Mark shall vacate within 30 days after the parties’ separation.
Upon the parties’ separation, all rights under this Agreement shall
terminate, except as to rights of ownership in specific items of real or personal property
previously acquired. The parties may then agree to continue their ownership of any
jointly-held real or personal property, or either may elect to have the property
partitioned. The property to be partitioned shall be divided in kind where feasible and
not an economic hardship to either party. In the event the property cannot be divided in
kind, it shall be divided by mutual agreement assigning assets of equal or nearly equal
value to each party, with an agreed cash payment as necessary to equalize the division.
If the parties cannot mutually agree, the property shall be sold and the proceeds divided
equally after deduction for all costs of sale. In any such division, no account shall be
taken of the income tax liability of ether party under federal, state or foreign law.
In the event the parties separate, or if this Agreement is terminated in any
other manner, both parties waive any right to recover pendente lite attorney fees, court
costs, or support in any action to enforce this Agreement. In the event of litigation to
enforce the rights under this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover
6[SAMPLE] Nonm arital Cohabitation Agreem ent MS___ AJ ___
reasonable attorney fees as costs of suit.
17. EFFECTIVE DATE.
This Agreement shall be effective as of the date of its execution by the second of the
parties to do so.
18. BINDING EFFECT.
This Agreement shall be binding on and inure to the benefit of the respective heirs,
assigns, administrators, executors, personal representatives, and successors in interest
of the parties.
19. ENTIRETY.
This Agreement contains the entire Agreement of the parties and supersedes all other
Agreements, whether written, oral, or implied, with regard to its subject matter. This
Agreement may be amended or modified only by another instrument in writing hereafter
signed by both parties.
20. GOVERNING LAW.
This Agreement has been drafted in the State of California and shall be governed by,
and construed and enforced in accordance with, California law.
21. SEVERABILITY.
If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it shall be
deemed severable from the remainder of the Agreement and shall not cause the
invalidity or unenforceability of the remainder of the Agreement. If such a provision is
deemed invalid because of its scope or breadth, the provision shall be deemed valid to
the extent of the scope or breadth permitted by law.
22. TITLES.
Paragraph titles in this Agreement are inserted as a matter of convenience and for
reference and in no way define, limit, extend, or describe the scope of this Agreement
or any of its provisions.
23. EFFECT OF DRAFTING PROVISIONS.
No provision of this Agreement may be interpreted for or against either party because
that party or that party’s legal representative drafted the provision.
7[SAMPLE] Nonm arital Cohabitation Agreem ent MS___ AJ ___
24. EXPENSES OF ENFORCEMENT.
In the event of any breach of this Agreement or any action contesting the validity or
seeking the enforcement of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled, in
addition to any other remedy provided by law, to receive from the other party his or her
reasonable attorney fees and costs resulting from the breach or incurred in connection
with the action.
25. INDEPENDENT REPRESENTATION.
Each party acknowledges that he or she has had independent representation by
counsel of his or her own choice in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement, or
has elected not to do so, and each fully understands the provisions and purposes of the
Agreement, and enters into and signs the Agreement freely and voluntarily. Other than
as set forth herein, no promises or inducements have been made by and between the
parties.
26. OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK COUNSEL.
Mark specifically agrees to pay such attorney’s fees as Audrey incurs relative to her
seeking and obtaining all legal advice which she wishes prior to the execution of this
Agreement, and Audrey may and is urged to seek advice from any attorney of her sole
choosing before executing this Agreement. Except as stated herein, Mark shall have
no obligation to contribute to any attorney fees hereafter incurred by Audrey.

III. CHILD CUSTODY AND VISITATION
The custody of the minor Child of the parties, namely, [NAME], shall be shared

agreement is only subject to modification by a court of competent jurisdiction in the best
interests of the children. To assist the court in any subsequent action concerning child

financial circumstances, making his support obligations under this agreement

his obligations, consistent with their then-existing financial circumstances. This
obligation is also subject to modification by a court of competent jurisdiction.

IX. TAX MATTERS
ANNUAL RETURNS
The parties agree to file joint federal and state income tax returns for the Tax
Year 2014, and for any subsequent year during which they shall be Husband and Wife
and entitled under the applicable laws and regulations to file joint returns, provided that
such filing results in a lesser combined tax than would result from separate filing. Each
party shall pay that proportionate share of the tax due as shall be attributable to his or
her respective earnings or income and each shall indemnify and hold harmless the
other against any liability for his or her own proportionate share of said tax. Any refund
that is realized as a result of a joint return shall be divided proportionately between the
parties.
X. COUNSEL FEES
The parties agree to divide equally all court costs in connection with any divorce
action which may be instituted at any time in the future between the parties hereto.

from any further obligations to pay any other or further counsel fees for each other or on
each other's behalf in connection with any matter, except for the costs of the
enforcement of the terms of this agreement in the event of one party's non-compliance,
in which case the non-complying party shall be responsible for all reasonable expenses
incurred in enforcement.
However, if any suit or action is brought to declare or to enforce the rights of one
of the parties under this agreement, the court may in its sound discretion award attorney
fees and costs to the prevailing party; and the court shall make such an award if the suit
or action is brought successfully to enforce a child or spousal support obligation.

will be responsible for their own counsel fees and costs in any subsequent divorce
action or other proceeding brought by either party.

in order to better meet our parental responsibilities and to safeguard our child(ren)’s future
development. We both recognize that our child(ren) wish to love and respect both of us,
regardless of our marital status or our place of residence, and that the welfare of our child(ren)
can best be served by our mutual cooperation as parents in shared parenting, and by each of
us providing a home in which they are loved and to which they belong. We also jointly
recognize that court proceedings regarding child(ren) and custody and access matters can be
detrimental to child(ren), and we therefore have decided to resolve these questions ourselves,
using this Shared Parenting Agreement. Finally, we have chosen to avoid the traditional
terminology surrounding divorce and child(ren) by using terms that more accurately describe
the reorganization of our former family to new homes or dual households. Accordingly, we
wish to instruct our respective attorneys, if necessary, to inform any courts involved in our
dissolution that our desires are as follows, regarding the custody and upbringing of our
child(ren).
1. Children: We hereby accept and identify the parentage, and agree to the surname of the
below named child(ren) applicable to this Shared Parenting Agreement as follows:

2. Terminology: In order to reaffirm our commitment of raising our child(ren) in a dual-
household status, we choose to use the terms “live with mother” and “live with father” in
describing our arrangement, rather than in terms of custody/primary and non-custodial/access
as may be defined in other legal documents.

18. Discipline and Reward: We agree that consistency in methods of discipline and reward
are important to ensuring responsible parenting and the healthy development of our child(ren).

love, concern, nurturing, and safety from both the mother and father.

child(ren)’s growth and development, and will not subvert or supplant pronouncements of

environment; or exposure to abusive, dangerous, or hazardous situations and circumstances
may also constitute acceptable reasons to assume temporary primary care, until such time
both parents are able to provide an adequate, safe home environment.
20. Standards of Parental Conduct: We acknowledge that while there may be
disagreements between us, we will not permit them to be inflicted upon our child(ren). We
further recognize that we are both good people, but by our differences which make us unique,
choose to no longer live together. We do however, believe that our child(ren) should hold a
positive image of two good parents, and we will work toward that end. In accomplishment of
our shared parenting goals we hereby resolve to:

Sample script for requesting an urgent child support order
1. (Bow.) Your Honour,
2. My name is Jane Smith, S-M-I-T-H.
3. I am the biological mother of the children Robert James Smith, 7 years old, and Lucy Ann
Smith, 5 years old.
4. The children live with me all the time.
5. The opposing party and I were married for 5 years. We separated 1 year ago.
6. I am here to get an order for child support for my children. The opposing party earns $45,000
per year. According to the child support guidelines, the opposing party should pay $423 per
month. The opposing party hasn’t paid any child support since July 2018.
7. I need the order for child support today and it is urgent. I can’t wait for the Family Case
Conference or a hearing, because I am behind on my rent and risk being evicted if the opposing
party does not pay some support right away. To support my request for an urgent order, I have
attached to my affidavit a letter from my landlord.
8. I also need an order that the opposing party has to file a complete financial statement in 30
days.
(The judge now says what they have decided as the next steps for your case. You may now repeat
back what they said to make sure you heard it correctly. You will then ask for either a copy of your
order or for an urgent hearing.)
9. Thank you, Your Honour. (Bow before you turn to leave.)

LIVING TRUST
LIVING TRUST
Every adult person should have an estate plan. One way of creating an estate plan is the living trust. The
purpose of this brochure is to give you answers to questions frequently asked about living trusts so you can
determine whether a living trust is right for you.
What is a living trust?
A living trust, also known as a revocable trust, is an alternative way to own property. You create a living trust
during your lifetime by signing a trust agreement which is a legal document that directs how property
transferred to the trust will be managed, when and to whom the income and principal from the trust will be paid,
and to whom the trust property will be distributed when you die. You are called the settlor, grantor, or trustor of
the trust, while the person to whom you transfer your property is called the trustee. The persons who will
receive the income during your lifetime or who will receive the trust property after your death, are called the
beneficiaries. You may be the settlor, a trustee and a beneficiary, all at the same time. The property in the trust
is called the trust principal, corpus, or res. As the settlor, you may change the terms of the trust agreement or
may revoke the trust and regain ownership of the trust property.
Do I need a living trust?
You may decide you need a living trust, but first you should review your own situation with your lawyer to
decide whether or not a trust is correct for you. It could be that a will, some other type of trust, or other
arrangements would better fit your situation.
Whom should I name as trustee?
You may be the only trustee or you may be a co-trustee. You may name another individual(s), or financial
institution with trust powers, as your trustee. You should also provide for a successor trustee to act in the future
in the event of your disability or after your death. Anyone you select as a co-trustee or successor trustee should
be capable and trustworthy. Family members may or may not be selected by you depending upon your
circumstances and their abilities. You should also consider whether a bank can provide services that an
individual cannot, but keep in mind that only banks with trust authority can act as trustee.
Why is there so much publicity about living trusts?
It is possible to avoid probate of assets held in a living trust. Much of the current interest comes from concern
and publicity about the perceived cost and length of time to complete a probate. Lengthy delays and excessive
costs of probate are problems in some heavily populated states, but in South
Dakota probate can be relatively simple and economical. You should consult with your lawyer about the
comparative costs of various estate plans.
What are the advantages of a living trust?
• You can have another person or bank which has expertise act as a trustee and make investment or other
management decisions for you.

Current as of 25 August 2022
• You can avoid the necessity of having a conservator manage your property if you become incompetent,
but only if all of your property is in the trust.
• After your death, the trustee can distribute the trust assets directly to the beneficiaries without probate.
This is particularly beneficial if you own real estate in more than one state as it may avoid having to
conduct a probate proceeding in each state.
• It may be more difficult to contest than a will.
• After your death, the costs and expenses for personal representatives, lawyers, accountants and others
may be less.
• It is possible that a living trust can be kept more confidential than a will.
What are the disadvantages of a living trust?
• You will undoubtedly spend more time and money in properly creating and transferring your assets to a
living trust than you would to have a will prepared.
• To effectively avoid probate, you must keep track of your assets and keep all of your property in the
trust, including property acquired after you create the trust.
• You may experience problems in transferring or selling assets or making purchases with trust checks
and encounter banks, transfer agents or others who want to see the trust agreement in order to know that
the trustee has certain powers and authority.
• Upon your disability or death, the management of your trust assets will depend upon the honesty and
management ability of your successor trustee who may act without court control or involvement.
• You may have to pay trustee's fees and expenses if you use a third party as trustee, including the costs of
filing an annual trust income tax return.
• Because a living trust does not require that notice be given to your creditors, a creditor can make a claim
against the trust beneficiaries years after your death.
• No court determines the validity of the trust as the case with a will.
Does a living trust save taxes?
The grantor of a revocable living trust retains control of the trust property. Therefore, for federal income tax
purposes, as long as you act as the trustee or the co-trustee and the trust uses your social security number for its
taxpayer identification number, your living trust will be treated no differently than if you had not created the
trust. Likewise, you will not save any death taxes (state or federal) simply because you have created a living
trust since you have not irrevocably disposed of the trust assets. Although, a properly prepared living trust can
save death taxes, exactly the same savings can be achieved by a will.
How do I transfer ownership of my property to the trust?
In order to avoid probate, you must transfer the ownership of each and every asset to the trust. To transfer real
property, a deed must be signed and recorded; transfer of publicly traded stocks and bonds will likely require
the services of a broker; transfer of partnerships and closely held corporations may require the review of the
governing instruments to determine whether other partners or stockholders must consent to such transfer; assets
without formal legal title such as household contents and farm machinery will require a bill of sale.
What if I do not transfer all of my property to the trust?
Any property which you do not transfer to the trust will be subject to probate and distribution as set out in your
will or the South Dakota laws providing for distribution of your estate if you do not have a will. You should
have a will to cover any assets that are not transferred to the trust. This may be a "pourover will" which
transfers any property which you own at the time of your death to your living trust or a will which has other
provisions.
Can my successor trustee immediately distribute property from the trust after my death?
Current as of 25 August 2022
Generally, no. Your trustee must first pay your debts and expenses resolve any trust problems, file tax returns
(income, state estate tax and federal estate tax) and pay any taxes that are due and owing.
Once I set up a trust, can I change my mind?
Yes. While you are alive and competent, you are in complete control of your trust. You may change or
terminate the trust at any time provided the trust document specifically gives you that right.
Can I use a living trust form or kit that I buy?
You can use a form or kit or even prepare the trust agreement yourself, but your situation may not fit the form,
or the form may have been poorly prepared and may lead to adverse tax consequences and conflicts over
property distributions. Problems with the forms or kits may not surface until years later, sometimes not until
after your death when you cannot change the trust and clear up the problem.
Warning
Certain publicity and persons selling living trust kits have been misleading people into thinking that the
property in a living trust is protected from taxes and creditors. This is not true! A living trust will not protect
your property from nursing home expenses, hospital bills, or other creditors, nor will the creation of a living
trust qualify you for Medicaid.
Conclusion
You have taken a lifetime to accumulate your wealth. You should take great care to make certain that your
estate plan carries out your wishes without problems. A living trust may or may not be right for you. Competent
professional help is essential to make certain that your estate plan meets your specific needs.

ESTATE PLANNING
Testamentary Trusts
What is a Testamentary Trust?
A testamentary trust is a discretionary trust established under a Will, which does not come into
effect until after the death of the Will maker. Testamentary trusts can provide considerable benefits
as they can be controlled by the beneficiary without forming part of that beneficiary’s estate.
The terms of a testamentary trust are similar, (but not as extensive) as those contained in most
family discretionary trusts. These trust terms are attached as a schedule to your Will.
Is a Testamentary Trust different from a Family Trust?
Yes. Although both testamentary and family trusts have similar features, such as the ability of the
trustee to decide which beneficiaries of the trust will receive income, there are considerable taxation
advantages for infant beneficiaries (under the age of 18 years) under a testamentary trust.
Income received by infant beneficiaries from a family trust will be subject to penalty tax rates if that
income exceeds approximately $416. Under a testamentary trust, infant beneficiaries receive the full
tax-free threshold, and any income above that amount is taxed at normal adult rates. With the
increase in the tax-free threshold from $6,000 to $18,200 in the 2012/2013 financial year, this
makes a testamentary trust an even better inheritance vehicle. In particular, combined with the low
income tax rebate, an individual can earn around $20,542 before paying any tax.
In particular, consider the tax savings in the following scenario:
Assume an older couple die leaving a combined estate (including their superannuation) valued at $2
million to be divided equally between their son and their daughter. If the inheritance was invested at
8%, each child’s share would generate an annual income of $80,000.
Example 1:
The Wills leave everything to the son and daughter personally (or they have no Wills). Both the son
and daughter’s tax position is therefore:
Beneficiary Income Tax (assuming no other income)
Son $80,000 $17,547
Daughter $80,000 $17,547
Example 2:
The Wills creates a testamentary trusts for each of the son and daughter, controlled by each of them
and providing for their respective families to be beneficiaries.
2
In respect to the son’s situation, he has a wife who is currently not working and three infant children.
Through the use of a testamentary trust for the son, the family’s tax position might then be:
Beneficiary Income Tax (assuming no other income)
Son’s Wife $20,000 $nil
Child 1 $20,000 $nil
Child 2 $20,000 $nil
Child 3 $20,000 $nil
As you can see, by sharing the income amongst beneficiaries of a testamentary trust, there are
significant tax savings available. It is also important to remember that these savings could apply
year after year.
The income distributed to the children could be used to pay for their expenses (such as school fees)
rather than cash being given to each child.
Asset Protection
An important feature of a testamentary trust is that an intended beneficiary may be able to control
their inheritance but in a way that the assets do not form part of the beneficiary’s estate.
This can be extremely important in the following circumstances:
1. where the intended beneficiary has a risk of becoming bankrupt and losing their inheritance
to the trustee in bankruptcy;
2. setting up an adequate fund to provide for a beneficiary with a disability in such a way so as
not to affect any pension rights they may have;
3. protection from Family Court orders. Whilst the testamentary trust may be regarded as a
financial resource of the beneficiary and have some consequential effect on the terms of a
property settlement, the property in the testamentary trust is more likely to not be at the
disposal of a Family Court order; and
4. providing asset protection for individuals in high risk occupation, i.e. rather than the assets
passing to that high risk individual, it is placed in a discretionary trust where the person does
not have direct ownership themselves.
Who can be trustee of a Testamentary Trust?
Anyone you wish but usually the trustees are the executors of your Will, your spouse or partner, or
your children.
The trustee has effective control of the trust, so the trustee should be a person whom you know, and
whom you trust to act in the best interests of the beneficiaries. It is possible to establish a number of
testamentary trusts under a Will and name different trustees and/or beneficiaries for each of them.
If I left my estate to a Testamentary Trust and my spouse needed the money, would my
spouse be able to gain access to it?
Generally the testamentary trust is structured so that the trustee has full discretion to make
distributions of capital at any time.
3
Usually the surviving spouse will be one of the trustees of the Testamentary Trust and will be in a
position to access capital from the testamentary trust if it is needed.
Dependant on your circumstances and in order to increase the asset protection qualities of a
testamentary trust, you may wish to also consider nominating an independent appointor. An
appointor has the power to remove and appoint a new trustee and can play a vital role in a
testamentary trust.
What should I consider before establishing a Testamentary Trust under my Will?
It is possible to structure the Will so that it provides for a testamentary trust but that the surviving
spouse can decide not to implement it if there are unlikely to be sufficient benefits from the trust
because of the circumstances which exist at the time of death.
You should be aware that the cost of making a Will with a testamentary trust established under it will
be more expensive than putting in place a simple Will. However, this is the only establishment cost
for a testamentary trust. There will also be ongoing administrative costs in maintaining the trust such
as accountancy fees for the preparation of annual taxation returns, but these only start to be
payable after the testamentary trust is established – which is after the death of the Will maker.
Important matters that you should consider when deciding whether a Testamentary Trust is
appropriate for you are:
 the assets and likely income to be generated by your estate;
 special needs of beneficiaries with disabilities or other issues that may affect their ability to
manage their financial affairs;
 the need to protect the inheritance of your children from creditors and subsequent divorce
settlements; and
 the need to protect the inheritance of individuals in high risk occupations.
In order to provide your beneficiaries with the most flexibility possible, it is possible to structure your
Will so that the intended beneficiary may bypass the testamentary trust as their inheritance vehicle if
it is appropriate at that particular time.
Before making any decision regarding a testamentary trust, we would recommend that you take the
time to speak with one of our experienced lawyers who would be able to advise you regarding the
potential benefits and appropriateness for the personal circumstances of yourself and your intended
beneficiaries.
What if I already have a Family Trust?
The assets of your family trust will not form part of your estate. If all of your assets are presently
owned by your family trust, there may be no point in establishing a testamentary trust unless you
planned to wind down your family trust and transfer the assets in it to yourself.
However, if it is likely your estate will have substantial assets in addition to those held in your
existing family trust there may still be advantages in considering a testamentary trust. Further, by
implementing a testamentary trust under the terms of your Will, you are able to establish a separate
trust for each intended beneficiary.
4
This means that their inheritance is not tied in together forevermore and they will have some
autonomy over decisions relating to their inheritance. Where beneficiaries’ interests are separated, it
is also less likely for any disputes to arise in the future regarding management of the testamentary
trust.
Is it possible to set up a similar trust after my death if I don’t change my Will now?
Yes, but there are limitations.
The beneficiaries of a “post-death testamentary trust” are essentially limited to your spouse and
children and there is also a limit on how much can be transferred to the trust.
Your trustees also have less flexibility in dealing with income and capital of a post death
testamentary trust and they can be expensive to establish.
What should you do next?
Testamentary trusts have many advantages including their flexibility, potential tax savings and
protection of the inheritance of your beneficiaries. If you would like more information or an
appointment to discuss an update to your wills to include testamentary trusts, please contact our
office to organise a meeting with a member of our experienced Estate Planning and Asset
Protection Team.

EXPLANATION FOR PRINCIPALS
WHAT IS A FINANCIAL POWER OF ATTORNEY?
This document is called a "Financial Power of Attorney." It allows you to name one or
more persons to help you handle your financial affairs. Depending on your individual
circumstances, you can give this person or persons complete or limited power to act on
your behalf. This document does not give someone the power to make medical decisions
or personal decisions for you.
WHAT CAN MY AGENT DO?
The "Agent" is the person you give power to handle your financial affairs.
The "Principal" is you.
Your decision to use this document is a very important one and you should think
carefully about what financial decisions you want your Agent to make for you. With this
document, you can give your Agent the right to make all financial decisions or only
certain, limited decisions.
For example, you can allow your Agent to handle all your financial affairs, including
the power to sell, rent, or mortgage your home, pay your bills, cash or deposit checks,
buy and sell your stock, investments, or personal items, or you can allow your Agent to
handle only certain or specific financial affairs such as to pay your monthly bills.
DO I GIVE ALL MY POWERS AWAY?
No. Even with this document, you can still handle your own financial affairs as long as
you choose to or are able to.
You need to talk to your Agent often about what you want and what he or she is doing
for you using the document. If your Agent is not following your instructions or doing
what you want, you may cancel or revoke the document and end your Agent's power to
act for you.
HOW DO I REVOKE MY FINANCIAL POWER OF ATTORNEY?
You may revoke your financial power of attorney by writing a signed and dated
revocation of power of attorney and giving it to your Agent. You should also give it to
anyone who has been relying upon the financial power of attorney and dealing with your
Agent, such as your bank and investment institutions.
Unless you notify all parties dealing with your Agent of your revocation, they may
continue to deal with your Agent. You should contact a lawyer if your Agent continues to
act after you have revoked the power of attorney.
WHEN DOES MY AGENT'S AUTHORITY END?
As long as you are living, the financial power of attorney will remain in effect even if
you become incapacitated or unable to communicate your wishes unless:
(1) A guardian is appointed for your property; or
(2) You include a date or specific occurrence when you want your document to be
canceled.
However, upon your death or the death of your Agent or successor Agents, the
document will be canceled and the Agent's power to act for you will end.
You can also include a date or a specific occurrence like your incapacity or illness as
the time when you want your document to be canceled and your Agent's power to act for
you to end.
WHEN DO THE POWERS TAKE EFFECT?
Depending on your circumstances, you may wish to specify an occurrence or a future
date for the document to become effective. Unless you do so, it becomes effective
immediately.
MUST MY AGENT DO THOSE THINGS I AUTHORIZE?
No. But if your Agent accepts this responsibility and agrees to act for you, he or she is
required to sign and date the "Acceptance of Appointment" contained in the financial
power of attorney form.
HOW DO I COMPLETE THIS DOCUMENT?
Both the Principal and the Agent should read the full document carefully before
initialing or signing. The Principal and the Agent should fully understand what powers
are being granted to the Agent and what restrictions, if any, exist.
Read each paragraph carefully. If you decide to give your Agent the power described in
the paragraph, initial your name at the end of the paragraph.
If you do not wish to give your Agent the power described in a paragraph, strike

Illinois Statutory Short Form
Power of Attorney for Health Care
NOTICE TO THE INDIVIDUAL SIGNING
THE POWER OF ATTORNEY FOR HEALTH CARE
No one can predict when a serious illness or accident might occur. When it does, you may need someone else to speak or make health
care decisions for you. If you plan now, you can increase the chances that the medical treatment you get will be the treatment you
want.
In Illinois, you can choose someone to be your “health care agent.” Your agent is the person you trust to make health care decisions
for you if you are unable or do not want to make them yourself. These decisions should be based on your personal values and wishes.
It is important to put your choice of agent in writing. The written form is often called an “advance directive”. You may use this form
or another form, as long as it meets the legal requirements of Illinois. There are many written and on-line resources to guide you and
your loved ones in having a conversation about these issues. You may find it helpful to look at these resources while thinking about
and discussing your advance directive.
WHAT ARE THE THINGS I WANT MY HEALTH CARE AGENT TO KNOW?
The selection of your agent should be considered carefully, as your agent will have the ultimate decision-making authority once this
document goes into effect, in most instances after you are no longer able to make your own decisions. While the goal is for your agent
to make decisions in keeping with your preferences and in the majority of circumstances that is what happens, please know that the
law does allow your agent to make decisions to direct or refuse health care interventions or withdraw treatment. Your agent will need
to think about conversations you have had, your personality, and how you handled important health care issues in the past. Therefore,
it is important to talk with your agent and your family about such things as:
(i) What is most important to you in your life?
(ii) How important is it to you to avoid pain and suffering?
(iii) If you had to choose, is it more important to you to live as long as possible, or to avoid prolonged suffering or disability?
(iv) Would you rather be at home or in a hospital for the last days or weeks of your life?
(v) Do you have religious, spiritual, or cultural beliefs that you want your agent and others to consider?
(vi) Do you wish to make a significant contribution to medical science after your death through organ or whole body donation?
(vii) Do you have an existing advance directive, such as a living will, that contains your specific wishes about health care that is
only delaying your death? If you have another advance directive, make sure to discuss with your agent the directive and the
treatment decisions contained within that outline your preferences. Make sure that your agent agrees to honor the wishes
expressed in your advance directive.
WHAT KIND OF DECISIONS CAN MY AGENT MAKE?
If there is ever a period of time when your physician determines that you cannot make your own health care decisions, or if you do not
want to make your own decisions, some of the decisions your agent could make are to:
(i) talk with physicians and other health care providers about your condition.
(ii) see medical records and approve who else can see them.
(iii) give permission for medical tests, medicines, surgery, or other treatments.
(iv) choose where you receive care and which physicians and others provide it.
(v) decide to accept, withdraw, or decline treatments designed to keep you alive if you are near death or not likely to recover.
You may choose to include guidelines and/or restrictions to your agent’s authority.
(vi) agree or decline to donate your organs or your whole body if you have not already made this decision yourself. This could
include donation for transplant, research, and/or education. You should let your agent know whether you are registered as a
donor in the First Person Consent registry maintained by the Illinois Secretary of State or whether you have agreed to donate
your whole body for medical research and/or education.
(vii) decide what to do with your remains after you have died, if you have not already made plans.
(viii) talk with your other loved ones to help come to a decision (but your designated agent will have the final say over your other
loved ones).
Your agent is not automatically responsible for your health care expenses.
WHOM SHOULD I CHOOSE TO BE MY HEALTH CARE AGENT?
You can pick a family member, but you do not have to. Your agent will have the responsibility to make medical treatment decisions,
even if other people close to you might urge a different decision. The selection of your agent should be done carefully, as he or she
will have ultimate decision-making authority for your treatment decisions once you are no longer able to voice your preferences.
Choose a family member, friend, or other person who:
(i) is at least 18 years old;
(ii) knows you well;
(iii) you trust to do what is best for you and is willing to carry out your wishes, even if he or she may not agree with your wishes;
(iv) would be comfortable talking with and questioning your physicians and other health care providers;
(v) would not be too upset to carry out your wishes if you became very sick; and
(vi) can be there for you when you need it and is willing to accept this important role.
WHAT IF MY AGENT IS NOT AVAILABLE OR IS
UNWILLING TO MAKE DECISIONS FOR ME?
If the person who is your first choice is unable to carry out this role, then the second agent you chose will make the decisions; if your
second agent is not available, then the third agent you chose will make the decisions. The second and third agents are called your
successor agents and they function as back-up agents to your first choice agent and may act only one at a time and in the order you list
them.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF I DO NOT CHOOSE A HEALTH CARE AGENT?
If you become unable to make your own health care decisions and have not named an agent in writing, your physician and other health
care providers will ask a family member, friend, or guardian to make decisions for you. In Illinois, a law directs which of these
individuals will be consulted. In that law, each of these individuals is called a "surrogate".
There are reasons why you may want to name an agent rather than rely on a surrogate:
(i) The person or people listed by this law may not be who you would want to make decisions for you.
(ii) Some family members or friends might not be able or willing to make decisions as you would want them to.
(iii) Family members and friends may disagree with one another about the best decisions.
(iv) Under some circumstances, a surrogate may not be able to make the same kinds of decisions that an agent can make.
WHAT IF THERE IS NO ONE AVAILABLE WHOM I TRUST TO BE MY AGENT?
In this situation, it is especially important to talk to your physician and other health care providers and create written guidance about
what you want or do not want, in case you are ever critically ill and cannot express your own wishes. You can complete a living will.
You can also write your wishes down and/or discuss them with your physician or other health care provider and ask him or her to
write it down in your chart. You might also want to use written or on-line resources to guide you through this process.
WHAT DO I DO WITH THIS FORM ONCE I COMPLETE IT?
Follow these instructions after you have completed the form:
(i) Sign the form in front of a witness. See the form for a list of who can and cannot witness it.
(ii) Ask the witness to sign it, too.
(iii) There is no need to have the form notarized.
(iv) Give a copy to your agent and to each of your successor agents.
(v) Give another copy to your physician.
(vi) Take a copy with you when you go to the hospital.
(vii) Show it to your family and friends and others who care for you.
WHAT IF I CHANGE MY MIND?
You may change your mind at any time. If you do, tell someone who is at least 18 years old that you have changed your mind, and/or
destroy your document and any copies. If you wish, fill out a new form and make sure everyone you gave the old form to has a copy
of the new one, including, but not limited to, your agents and your physicians.
WHAT IF I DO NOT WANT TO USE THIS FORM?
In the event you do not want to use the Illinois statutory form provided here, any document you complete must be executed by you,
designate an agent who is over 18 years of age and not prohibited from serving as your agent, and state the agent's powers, but it need
not be witnessed or conform in any other respect to the statutory health care power.
If you have questions about the use of any form, you may want to consult your physician, other health care provider, and/or an
attorney.

If a guardian of my person is to be appointed, I nominate the agent acting under this power of attorney as guardian.
MY AGENT CAN MAKE HEALTH CARE DECISIONS FOR ME, INCLUDING:
(i) Deciding to accept, withdraw, or decline treatment for any physical or mental condition of mine, including life-and-death
decisions.
(ii) Agreeing to admit me to or discharge me from any hospital, home, or other institution, including a mental health facility.
(iii) Having complete access to my medical and mental health records, and sharing them with others as needed, including after I
die.
(iv) Carrying out the plans I have already made, or, if I have not done so, making decisions about my body or remains, including
organ, tissue, or whole body donation, autopsy, cremation, and burial.
I AUTHORIZE MY AGENT TO: (Please check only one box. If no box is checked, or if more than one box is
checked, the directive in the first box below shall be implemented.)
Make decisions for me only when I cannot make them for myself. The physician(s) taking care of me will determine when I
lack this ability.
Make decisions for me only when I cannot make them for myself. The physician(s) taking care of me will determine when I
lack this ability. Starting now, for the purpose of assisting me with my health care plans and decisions, my agent shall have
complete access to my medical and mental health records, the authority to share them with others as needed, and the
complete ability to communicate with my personal physician(s) and other health care providers, including the ability to
require an opinion of my physician as to whether I lack the ability to make decisions for myself.
Make decisions for me starting now and continuing after I am no longer able to make them for myself. While I am still able
to make my own decisions, I can still do so if I want to.
LIFE-SUSTAINING TREATMENTS:
The subject of life-sustaining treatment is of particular importance. Life-sustaining treatments may include tube feedings or fluids
through a tube, breathing machines, and CPR. In general, in making decisions concerning life-sustaining treatment, your agent is
instructed to consider the relief of suffering, the quality as well as the possible extension of your life, and your previously expressed
wishes. Your agent will weigh the burdens versus benefits of proposed treatments in making decisions on your behalf.
Additional statements concerning the withholding or removal of life-sustaining treatment are described below. These can serve as a
guide for your agent when making decisions for you. Ask your physician or health care provider if you have any questions about these
statements. SELECT ONLY ONE STATEMENT BELOW THAT BEST EXPRESSES YOUR WISHES (optional):
The quality of my life is more important than the length of my life. If I am unconscious and my attending physician believes,
in accordance with reasonable medical standards, that I will not wake up or recover my ability to think, communicate with
my family and friends, and experience my surroundings, I do not want treatments to prolong my life or delay my death, but I
do want treatment or care to make me comfortable and to relieve me of pain.
Staying alive is more important to me, no matter how sick I am, how much I am suffering, the cost of the procedures, or how
unlikely my chances for recovery are. I want my life to be prolonged to the greatest extent possible in accordance with
reasonable medical standards.
SPECIFIC LIMITATIONS TO MY AGENT'S DECISION-MAKING AUTHORITY:
The above grant of power is intended to be as broad as possible so that your agent will have the authority to make any decision you
could make to obtain or terminate any type of health care. If you wish to limit the scope of your agent's powers or prescribe special
rules or limit the power to authorize autopsy or dispose of remains, you may do so specifically on the lines below or add another page

What is a Living Will?
It is important for people to plan their future healthcare, especially at a time when they may no longer be
able to make decisions or communicate these decisons. The “Living Will” will provide people the
opportunity to think about, talk about and write down their wishes, preferences, priorities and refusals. They
can make their own decisions on how they would like to be cared for and what they prefer to have and have
not towards the end of their life. They may find it helpful to talk to their family and friends about their future
care. Although families and loved ones may become emotional or disagree with their decisions, talking about
these things openly can often be very helpful for the future. It will help all concerned to understand what is
important for the person making the decision and to know the views, wishes and preferences of the person
about the array of treatment options offered by the health care professionals at end of life. It will help them
to be clear about the decisions they make. The “Living Will” is a written record of person’s wishes that will
help the nominated person(s) or your family to carry out person’s wishes at the appropriate time without any
guilt or angst.
Preferred priorities can be stated. This means those things they wish or prefer to have towards the end of
life. It involves aspects like their preferred place of care and death (home or hospital), nature of treatment
they would like to receive, information about their health and illness they would like to know and the
supports they would like to access at end of life.
It is preferable to be clear about binding refusals. This means those components of medical care they wish
or prefer not to have towards their end of life. It involves avoidance of IV fluids, antibiotics, blood products,
hospitalisation, intensive care admission, oxygen, dialysis, feeding tubes, artificial nutrition etc. It also
involves confirming a preference of not to have invasive medical procedures aimed at resuscitation like chest
compressions, mechanical ventilation, drugs to increase blood pressure, invasive tubes, artificial machines
aimed at keeping a person alive at the end of their life. Although these are termed binding refusals, in certain
situations the Surrogate (the person who has been given Health Care Power of Attorney) can override them
based on medical advice, if it is thought that the situation may significantly improve with a short period of
the above treatments.
Can the person making this decision cancel his/her decision or change the preferred priorities and
binding refusals?
Yes, the person making the Living Will can cancel their decision and discard this form any time. They can
also change your preferred priorities and binding refusals at any time. They can also redo the form again and
change the nominated persons. To ensure that everyone has the current version of the “Living Will” they are
advised to destroy the earlier versions and keep a copy of the current version with them and share the current
version with their general practitioner and with their hospital physician and hospital medical records.
What is nominating a Surrogate or Health Care Power of Attorney?
Medicine is an inexact and rapidly changing science. Not all situations can be foreseen. Some treatments
that may have a binding refusal in the living will may be required for a short period and there may be a good
chance of recovery. These situations require doctors and health care professionals to interact with someone
who can represent the patient for shared decision making. This person is the Surrogate (also termed Health
Care Power of Attorney). The Living Will allows the patient to appoint in advance some person(s) to make
healthcare decisions if and when s/he is unable to make these decisions. The Living Will gives the Surrogate
the authority to make decisions on behalf of the person only when the person has been determined unable to
make their own decisions by the health care providers. It does not give authority to the Surrogate to make
financial or other business decisions. It is very important for the person making the Living Will to discuss
their views, values, and the provisions of this document with their Surrogate. It is important for the Surrogate
to understand person’s wishes, preferences and the refusals stated in the document, accept and agree with
the plan and willing to execute it at the appointed time. Preferably the consenting Surrogate should also sign
on the Living Will form or the patient must confirm on the form that the Surrogate has accepted this
responsibility.
What are my role and responsibilities as a Surrogate (Health Care Power of Attorney)?
This appointment shall become effective only when the person making the Living Will is unable to
participate in the health treatment decisions. You will act on behalf of the person making the Living Will
and advocate for person’s wishes, preferences and refusals stated in the document. You may have to advocate
on behalf of the person with the person’s family, health care provider and hospital administration. You have
to agree and accept the role of the Surrogate and if possible demonstrate your acceptance by signing the
Living Will form.
You will not exercise powers concerning the person’s finances or businesses, family custody, legal
transactions, property, employment etc. You cannot receive payment for serving as a Patient Advocate and
will not be reimbursed for expenses which you may incur in fulfilling your role and responsibilities as a
Patient Advocate. The person making his Living Will has every right to revoke your appointment and appoint
others. You cannot override the decision of the healthcare provider if he/she feels that you are not acting in
the best interests of the patient or the wishes and preferences stated in the Living Will are not applicable to
the current health situation.
When will the Living Will come into effect?
The “Living Will” will come into effect only when the person making the Living Will is unable to make or
communicate a decision for themselves. At this time the health care provider will refer to the wishes,
preferences and the refusals stated in the document and will consult the person nominated by the person or
their family before carrying out the wishes. The healthcare provider will be guided by the person’s best
interests and if the healthcare provider finds that provisions of the living will or the opinion of the nominated
person or family is not consistent with the health care situation, the healthcare provider has the right to
disregard the Living Will. The overarching purpose of the Living Will is to provide a humane, comfortable
and dignified end of life and avoid potentially inappropriate treatment against the patient’s wishes.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR ISSUING AN OOH-DNR ORDER
PURPOSE: The Out-of-Hospital Do-Not-Resuscitate (OOH-DNR) Order on reverse side complies with Health and Safety Code (HSC), Chapter 166 for use by
qualified persons or their authorized representatives to direct health care professionals to forgo resuscitation attempts and to permit the person to have a natural death
with peace and dignity. This Order does NOT affect the provision of other emergency care, including comfort care.
APPLICABILITY: This OOH-DNR Order applies to health care professionals in out-of-hospital settings, including physicians' offices, hospital clinics and
emergency departments.
IMPLEMENTATION: A competent adult person, at least 18 years of age, or the person's authorized representative or qualified relative may execute or issue an
OOH-DNR Order. The person's attending physician will document existence of the Order in the person's permanent medical record. The OOH-DNR Order may be
executed as follows:
Section A - If an adult person is competent and at least 18 years of age, he/she will sign and date the Order in Section A.
Section B - If an adult person is incompetent or otherwise mentally or physically incapable of communication and has either a legal guardian, agent in a medical
power of attorney, or proxy in a directive to physicians, the guardian, agent, or proxy may execute the OOH-DNR Order by signing and dating it in Section B.
Section C - If the adult person is incompetent or otherwise mentally or physically incapable of communication and does not have a guardian, agent, or proxy, then a
qualified relative may execute the OOH-DNR Order by signing and dating it in Section C.
Section D - If the person is incompetent and his/her attending physician has seen evidence of the person's previously issued proper directive to physicians or observed
the person competently issue an OOH-DNR Order in a nonwritten manner, the physician may execute the Order on behalf of the person by signing and dating it in
Section D.
Section E - If the person is a minor (less than 18 years of age), who has been diagnosed by a physician as suffering from a terminal or irreversible condition,
then the minor's parents, legal guardian, or managing conservator may execute the OOH-DNR Order by signing and dating it in Section E.
Section F - If an adult person is incompetent or otherwise mentally or physically incapable of communication and does not have a guardian, agent, proxy, or available
qualified relative to act on his/her behalf, then the attending physician may execute the OOH-DNR Order by signing and dating it in Section F with concurrence of a
second physician (signing it in Section F) who is not involved in the treatment of the person or who is a representative of the ethics or medical committee of the health
care facility in which the person is a patient.
In addition, the OOH-DNR Order must be signed and dated by two competent adult witnesses, who have witnessed either the competent adult person making his/her
signature in section A, or authorized declarant making his/her signature in either sections B, C, or E, and if applicable, have witnessed a competent adult person
making an OOH-DNR Order by nonwritten communication to the attending physician, who must sign in Section D and also the physician's statement section.
Optionally, a competent adult person or authorized declarant may sign the OOH-DNR Order in the presence of a notary public. However, a notary cannot
acknowledge witnessing the issuance of an OOH-DNR in a nonwritten manner, which must be observed and only can be acknowledged by two qualified witnesses.
Witness or notary signatures are not required when two physicians execute the OOH-DNR Order in section F. The original or a copy of a fully and properly completed
OOH-DNR Order or the presence of an OOH-DNR device on a person is sufficient evidence of the existence of the original OOH-DNR Order and either one shall be
honored by responding health care professionals.
REVOCATION: An OOH-DNR Order may be revoked at ANY time by the person, person's authorized representative, or physician who executed the order.
Revocation can be by verbal communication to responding health care professionals, destruction of the OOH-DNR Order, or removal of all OOH-DNR identification
devices from the person.
AUTOMATIC REVOCATION: An OOH-DNR Order is automatically revoked for a person known to be pregnant or in the case of unnatural or suspicious
circumstances.

Pay your bills
Pay your bills and keep all paperwork in a safe place. Some
providers will not see you if you have unpaid bills. You may be
able to pay your bills online or over the phone. This can vary
depending on your health plan and coverage.
Appeals
If you disagree with a coverage or payment decision by your health
plan, you may be able to appeal. If you think you were charged for tests
or services your coverage should pay for, keep the bill. Call your health
plan right away. Health plans have call and support centers to help.
