I. What is a Contractual Legal Document?

At its core, a contractual legal document is a legally binding agreement between two or more parties. This agreement outlines the specific terms and conditions under which the parties will perform certain actions or refrain from performing certain actions. The document serves as a written record of this agreement, providing clarity and a framework for resolving any potential disputes.

Key Characteristics:

    Legally Binding: This is the defining feature. A valid contract creates legal obligations that can be enforced by a court of law.
    Agreement: It signifies a mutual understanding and consent between the parties involved. This "meeting of the minds" is crucial.
    Parties: A contract requires at least two distinct parties, each with the legal capacity to enter into an agreement. These can be individuals, corporations, partnerships, or other legal entities.
    Terms and Conditions: These are the specific details of the agreement, outlining the rights, obligations, and responsibilities of each party.
    Written Record: While oral contracts can sometimes be valid, most significant agreements are documented in writing to avoid ambiguity and provide concrete evidence.

Purpose of a Contractual Legal Document:

    Clarity and Certainty: It clearly defines the expectations of each party, reducing the likelihood of misunderstandings or disputes.
    Risk Allocation: Contracts allow parties to allocate risks and responsibilities in a way that is mutually agreeable.
    Facilitation of Transactions: They provide a structured framework for business dealings, ensuring that all parties are aware of their obligations before proceeding.
    Enforceability: In the event of a breach (failure to fulfill obligations), the written contract provides evidence that can be used in legal proceedings to seek remedies.
    Long-Term Relationships: For ongoing relationships, contracts establish a stable foundation and a mechanism for addressing changes or issues that may arise.

II. Essential Elements of a Valid Contract:

For a contractual document to be legally valid and enforceable, it must typically contain the following essential elements:

    Offer:
        Definition: A clear and unambiguous expression of willingness by one party (the offeror) to enter into a contract on specific terms.
        Communication: The offer must be communicated to the other party (the offeree).
        Intention to Create Legal Relations: The offer must be made with the genuine intention that it will become binding upon acceptance. Social invitations or casual promises generally don't qualify.
        Definiteness: The terms of the offer must be sufficiently clear and specific to allow the offeree to understand exactly what is being proposed. Vague or uncertain offers are usually invalid.

    Acceptance:
        Definition: An unqualified and unequivocal assent by the offeree to all the terms of the offer.
        Communication: Acceptance must be communicated to the offeror in the manner specified in the offer or, if no specific manner is stated, in a reasonable manner. Silence generally does not constitute acceptance.
        Mirror Image Rule: In many jurisdictions, the acceptance must mirror the offer exactly. Any changes or additions constitute a counter-offer, which rejects the original offer and proposes a new one.

    Consideration:
        Definition: Something of value that is exchanged between the parties. It can be a promise to do something, a promise to refrain from doing something, or the actual performance of an act or forbearance.   

        "Quid pro quo": This Latin phrase, meaning "something for something," captures the essence of consideration. Each party must give or promise to give something of value in exchange for the other party's promise or performance.
        Adequacy vs. Sufficiency: Courts generally don't inquire into the adequacy of consideration (whether it's a fair market value), but it must be sufficient in the eyes of the law (real and having some value). Nominal consideration can sometimes be sufficient.
        Past Consideration: Generally, an act or forbearance that has already occurred before a promise is made is not considered valid consideration.

    Intention to Create Legal Relations:
        Definition: The parties must have a genuine intention that their agreement will have legal consequences and be enforceable in a court of law.
        Presumptions:
            Commercial Agreements: In business or commercial contexts, there is generally a presumption that the parties intend to create legal relations. This presumption can be rebutted by clear language in the agreement (e.g., "This is not a legally binding document").
            Social or Domestic Agreements: In agreements between family members or friends, there is generally a presumption that there is no intention to create legal relations. This presumption can be rebutted by clear evidence to the contrary (e.g., a formal written agreement).

    Capacity to Contract:
        Definition: The parties entering into the contract must have the legal capacity to do so. Certain individuals or entities may have limited or no capacity.
        Common Incapacities:
            Minors (Infants): Generally, contracts entered into by minors are voidable at the option of the minor (with some exceptions for necessities). The age of majority varies by jurisdiction.
            Persons of Unsound Mind: Individuals who are mentally incapacitated (e.g., due to severe mental illness or intoxication) may lack the capacity to enter into binding contracts.
            Corporations: A corporation's capacity to contract is generally defined by its memorandum and articles of association.
            Bankrupts: Individuals declared bankrupt may have restrictions on their ability to enter into contracts.

    Legality of Object:
        Definition: The purpose or object of the contract must be legal and not contrary to public policy.
        Examples of Illegal Objects: Contracts involving illegal activities (e.g., drug trafficking), contracts that restrain trade unreasonably, contracts that interfere with the administration of justice, or contracts that are considered immoral. Such contracts are generally void.

    Certainty of Terms:
        Definition: The terms of the contract must be clear, precise, and unambiguous. The parties should be able to understand their obligations with reasonable certainty.
        Vagueness and Ambiguity: If the terms are too vague or ambiguous, the contract may be deemed unenforceable because a court would not be able to determine the parties' obligations.

    Possibility of Performance:
        Definition: The obligations under the contract must be capable of being performed. A contract to do something that is physically or legally impossible is generally void.
        Examples of Impossibility: Contracting to sell something that doesn't exist, contracting to perform an illegal act.

III. Types of Contracts:

Contracts can be categorized in various ways based on different criteria:

Based on Formation:

    Express Contract: The terms of the contract are explicitly stated, either orally or in writing.
    Implied Contract: The terms of the contract are not explicitly stated but are inferred from the conduct of the parties or the surrounding circumstances. For example, ordering food at a restaurant implies a contract to pay for it.
    Quasi-Contract (Implied-in-Law Contract): This is not a true contract but rather a legal obligation imposed by law to prevent unjust enrichment. It arises when one party confers a benefit on another party, and it would be unfair for the other party to retain the benefit without paying for it.   

Based on Performance:

    Unilateral Contract: One party makes a promise in exchange for an act by the other party. The other party is not obligated to perform the act, but if they do, the first party is bound by their promise. Example: A reward offered for finding a lost pet.
    Bilateral Contract: Both parties exchange promises. Each party is obligated to perform their respective promise. This is the most common type of contract. Example: A contract for the sale of goods where the buyer promises to pay, and the seller promises to deliver the goods.
    Executed Contract: A contract where both parties have fully performed their obligations.
    Executory Contract: A contract where one or both parties still have obligations to perform in the future.

Based on Validity:

    Valid Contract: A contract that meets all the essential elements and is enforceable by law.
    Void Contract: A contract that has no legal effect from the beginning. It lacks one or more of the essential elements.
    Voidable Contract: A contract that is valid but can be avoided (cancelled) by one or both parties due to certain factors, such as misrepresentation, fraud, coercion, or undue influence.
    Unenforceable Contract: A contract that is valid in its formation but cannot be enforced by a court due to some legal impediment, such as the lack of a written record where required by law (e.g., the Statute of Frauds in some jurisdictions).

IV. Key Clauses in a Contractual Legal Document:

The specific clauses included in a contract will vary depending on the nature of the agreement. However, some common and important clauses include:

    Identification of Parties: Clearly identifies the full legal names and addresses of all parties involved in the contract.
    Recitals (Background): Provides a brief overview of the context and purpose of the agreement. Often starts with "WHEREAS..."
    Definitions: Defines key terms used throughout the contract to avoid ambiguity.
    Scope of Work/Deliverables: Clearly outlines the specific tasks, services, or goods that one party is obligated to provide to the other.
    Term and Termination: Specifies the duration of the contract and the conditions under which it can be terminated by either party (e.g., breach, mutual agreement, expiry of term).   

    Payment Terms: Details how, when, and how much payment will be made for the goods or services provided.
    Intellectual Property Rights: Addresses the ownership and usage of any intellectual property created or used in connection with the contract.
    Confidentiality (Non-Disclosure): Obligates one or both parties to keep certain information confidential.
    Warranties and Representations: Statements made by one party to the other about the state of affairs or the quality of goods or services. Warranties are promises that if untrue, can lead to a breach of contract claim. Representations are statements of fact that, if false, can lead to claims of misrepresentation.
    Indemnification: A clause where one party agrees to protect the other party against financial loss or liability arising from certain events.
    Limitation of Liability: Sets limits on the amount of damages that one party can recover from the other in case of a breach.
    Force Majeure: Excuses a party from performing its obligations if an unforeseen event beyond its control (e.g., natural disaster, war) makes performance impossible or impracticable.
    Governing Law and Jurisdiction: Specifies which jurisdiction's laws will govern the interpretation and enforcement of the contract and where any legal disputes will be resolved.
    Dispute Resolution: Outlines the process for resolving disputes, which may include negotiation, mediation, arbitration, or litigation.
    Entire Agreement Clause (Integration Clause): States that the written contract constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes any prior agreements or discussions.
    Severability Clause: Provides that if any part of the contract is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will still remain in effect.
    Notices: Specifies how formal communications between the parties should be made (e.g., by mail, email).
    Assignment: Addresses whether either party can transfer their rights or obligations under the contract to a third party.
    Amendment: Specifies the process for making changes or modifications to the contract (usually requires a written agreement signed by both parties).

V. The Lifecycle of a Contract:

Understanding the lifecycle of a contract provides a comprehensive view of its journey:

    Drafting: The initial stage where the terms of the agreement are put into writing. This can be done by one party or collaboratively.
    Negotiation: Parties discuss and potentially modify the terms of the draft contract until a mutually acceptable agreement is reached.
    Execution (Signing): Once the terms are agreed upon, the contract is signed by all parties, signifying their consent and intent to be bound. The date of execution is also usually recorded.
    Performance: The period during which the parties fulfill their respective obligations as outlined in the contract.
    Termination: The contract comes to an end, either through completion of the agreed-upon term, mutual agreement, breach by one party, or other specified reasons.
    Potential Breach and Remedies: If one party fails to perform their obligations (breaches the contract), the other party may have legal remedies available, such as seeking damages or specific performance.

VI. Important Considerations and Legal Aspects:

    Interpretation of Contracts: Courts interpret contracts based on the plain meaning of the words used, but they may also consider the context, the intentions of the parties, and industry custom. Ambiguities are often construed against the party who drafted the contract.
    Breach of Contract: Occurs when one party fails to perform their obligations under the contract without a valid legal excuse.
        Types of Breach: Material breach (significant failure to perform), minor breach (less significant failure).
        Remedies for Breach:
            Damages: Monetary compensation to the injured party to cover their losses. This can include compensatory damages (to cover actual losses), consequential damages (losses that were a foreseeable result of the breach), and sometimes punitive damages (to punish the breaching party in cases of egregious conduct).
            Specific Performance: A court order requiring the breaching party to perform their obligations under the contract (usually granted when monetary damages are inadequate, such as in contracts for the sale of unique property).
            Injunction: A court order prohibiting a party from doing something that would violate the contract.
            Rescission: Termination of the contract, and the parties are restored to their pre-contractual positions.
      

    Factors Affecting Validity: Certain factors can render a contract invalid or voidable:
        Mistake: A misunderstanding about a material fact relating to the contract. Can be unilateral (one party mistaken) or mutual (both parties mistaken).
        Misrepresentation: A false statement of fact made by one party to induce the other party to enter into the contract. Can be innocent, negligent, or fraudulent.
        Fraud: Intentional misrepresentation made with the knowledge of its falsity and the intent to deceive.
        Coercion (Duress): Illegitimate pressure or threats used to force someone into a contract.
        Undue Influence: Unfair persuasion by a party in a dominant position over a weaker party.
    Contract Law in India (Example): In India, contract law is primarily governed by the Indian Contract Act, 1872. This Act outlines the essential elements of a valid contract, different types of contracts, and remedies for breach. Similar legislation exists in other jurisdictions, though specific provisions may vary.
    Importance of Legal Advice: It is highly advisable to seek legal counsel when drafting, reviewing, or entering into significant contractual agreements. A lawyer can help ensure that the contract accurately reflects the parties' intentions, complies with applicable laws, and protects your interests.

VII. The Digital Age and Contractual Documents:

The advent of digital technologies has significantly impacted contractual documents:

    Electronic Contracts (E-Contracts): Contracts formed and executed electronically, often through online platforms.
    Digital Signatures: Electronic equivalents of handwritten signatures, often legally recognized and binding.
    Smart Contracts: Self-executing contracts written in code and stored on a blockchain. They automatically enforce the terms of the agreement when predefined conditions are met.
    Online Contract Management Systems: Software solutions used to manage the entire contract lifecycle, from drafting to execution to renewal or termination.

VIII. Conclusion:

Contractual legal documents are the bedrock of countless transactions and relationships in both personal and professional spheres. They provide a framework for agreement, allocate risks, and offer recourse in case of disputes. Understanding the essential elements, different types, key clauses, and the lifecycle of a contract is crucial for anyone entering into such agreements. Remember that contract law can be complex and vary by jurisdiction, making it essential to seek legal advice when dealing with significant contracts.

KNOW YOUR SUPPLIER
Aid agencies should hold sufficient information about the circumstances and business
of their supplier (in this case financial service provider) and its beneficial owners to
inform their risk assessment processes, and thus manage their money laundering and
terrorist financing risks effectively.
The information about a hawala agent or MSB that they should consider obtaining as part of
their risk assessment includes:
Maturity of the business, and its owners’ experience
It is relevant to consider whether or not the MSB is a new or established operation, the level of
experience the management and those running the business have in this type of activity, and
whether or not providing money services are the customer’s primary, or an ancillary, business.
Location(s) and market(s) served
Money laundering risks within an MSB can vary widely depending on the locations, customer
bases, and markets served. Relevant considerations include whether markets served are
domestic or international, or whether services are targeted to local residents or to broad
markets.
It is important to know and understand any associations the MSB may have with other
jurisdictions (headquarters, operating facilities, branches, subsidiaries, etc.) and the individuals
who may influence its operations (political connections, etc.). A visit to the place of business
may be helpful to confirm the existence and activities of the entity.
Ownership and control
In deciding who the beneficial owner is in relation to a customer who is not a private individual,
the objective must be to know who has ownership or control over the funds which form or
otherwise relate to the relationship, and/or form the controlling mind and/or management of any
legal entity involved in the funds.
*Guide for how to interpret: ‘highest reasonable standard of diligence’
The following questions should be used to guide the conversation with the agent when an aid
agency is establishing whether he is an appropriate partner.
(1) Agent selection: who is your agent at the pay-out destination? How long have you been
dealing with them? Is this an established relationship (i.e. are you related to them or have
you conducted long-standing business with this person), or a new relationship?
(2) Payment method: how do you settle payment with your agents? By cash courier; trade;
bank; third party settlement?
(3) Human resources: will you use your own resources, or will you outsource some of the
assignment? What is your capacity, and the acocuntability built into other relationships?
(4) Working capital: what is your average transaction size, and your largest?

1) If any insurance coverage required in this Agreement is provided on a “Claims Made” rather than
“Occurrence” form, CONSULTANT agrees to maintain the required coverage for a period of three
(3) years after the expiration of this Agreement (hereinafter “post agreement coverage”) and any
extensions thereof. CONSULTANT may maintain the required post agreement coverage by renewal
or purchase of prior acts or tail coverage. This provision is contingent upon post agreement coverage
being both available and reasonably affordable in relation to the coverage provided during the term of
this Agreement. For purposes of interpreting this requirement, a cost not exceeding 100% of the last
annual policy premium during the term of this Agreement in order to purchase prior acts or tail
coverage for post agreement coverage shall be deemed to be reasonable. The COMMISSION will not
be responsible for any premiums or assessments on the policy.
2) All required Automobile and Comprehensive or Commercial General Liability Insurance shall be
endorsed to contain the following clause:
“Santa Cruz County Regional Transportation Commission, its officials, employees, agents and
volunteers are added as an additional insured as respects the operations and activities of, or on behalf
of, the named insured performed under Agreement with the Commission.”
3) All required insurance policies shall be endorsed to contain the following clause:
“This insurance shall not be canceled until after thirty (30) days prior written notice has been given
to:
Santa Cruz County Regional Transportation Commission
Attn: Yesenia Parra
1523 Pacific Avenue
Santa Cruz, CA 95060
4) CONSULTANT agrees to provide its insurance broker(s) with a full copy of these insurance
provisions and provide COMMISSION on or before the effective date of this Agreement with
Certificates of Insurance for all required coverages. All Certificates of Insurance shall be delivered or
sent to:
Santa Cruz County Regional Transportation Commission
Attn: Yesenia Parra
1523 Pacific Avenue
Santa Cruz, CA 95060
5) The CONSULTANT agrees that the insurance herein provided for, shall be in effect at all times
during the term of this contract. In the event said insurance coverage expires at any time or times
during the term of this contract, the CONSULTANT agrees to provide at least thirty (30) days prior
notice to said expiration date; and a new Certificate of Insurance evidencing insurance coverage as
provided for herein, for not less than either the remainder of the term of the contract, or for a period
of not less than one (1) year. New Certificates of Insurance are subject to the approval of the
COMMISSION. In the event the CONSULTANT fails to keep in effect at all times insurance
Page 5
coverage as herein provided, the COMMISSION may, in addition to any other remedies it may have,
terminate this Agreement upon occurrence of such event.
6) If any insurance policy of CONSULTANT required by this document includes language
conditioning the insurer’s legal obligation to defend or indemnify COMMISSION on the
performance of any act(s) by the named insured, then said insurance policy, by endorsement,
shall also name the COMMISSION as a named insured. Notwithstanding the foregoing, both
the CONSULTANT and its insurers agree that by naming the COMMISSION as a named
insured, the COMMISSION may at its sole direction, but is not obligated to, perform any act
required by the named insured under said insurance policies.
7) CONSULTANT shall do all things required to be performed by it pursuant to its insurance policies
including but not limited to paying within five (5) work days, all deductibles and self-insured
retentions (SIR) required to be paid under any insurance policy that may provide defense or
indemnity coverage to COMMISSION or any additional insured.
8) CONSULTANT shall cause the foregoing provisions to be inserted in all subcontracts for any work
covered under this Agreement by a subconsultant compensated more than $50,000 and employing
more than fifteen (15) employees, provided that the foregoing provisions shall not apply to contracts
or subcontracts for standard commercial supplies or raw materials.
7. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS. CONSULTANT warrants that in the performance of this
Agreement, it shall exercise usual and customary professional care in its efforts to comply with all applicable
federal, state and local laws, statutes and ordinances and all lawful orders, rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder. In the event of a conflict between the laws and lawful regulations of any government entities
having jurisdiction over the project, the CONSULTANT shall notify COMMISSION of the nature and
impact of such conflict. The COMMISSION agrees to cooperate and work with the CONSULTANT in an
effort to resolve any conflict.
8. EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY. During and in relation to the performance of this Agreement,
CONSULTANT agrees to the following:
The CONSULTANT shall not discriminate or permit discrimination against any employee or applicant for
employment in any manner prohibited by Federal, State and local laws, including but not limited to race,
color, gender, religion, national origin, ancestry, physical or mental disability, medical condition, marital
status, sexual orientation, age (over 18), veteran status, pregnancy, or any other non-merit factor unrelated to
job duties.
Such action shall include, but not be limited to, the following: recruitment; advertising, layoff or termination;
rates of pay or other forms of compensation; and selection for training (including apprenticeship),
employment, upgrading, demotion, or transfer. The CONSULTANT agrees to post in conspicuous places,
available to employees and applicants for employment, notice setting forth the provisions of this non-
discrimination clause.
CONSULTANT shall comply fully with all federal, State and local laws and regulations which prohibit
discrimination. The CONSULTANT’s signature affixed herein, and dated, shall constitute a certification
under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California that the CONSULTANT has, unless
exempt, complied with, the nondiscrimination program requirements of Government Code Section 12990 and
Title 2, California Administrative Code, Section 8103.
Page 6
In the event of CONSULTANT’S non-compliance with the non-discrimination clauses of this Agreement or
with any of the said rules, regulations or orders the COMMISSION may cancel, terminate or suspend the
Agreement in whole or in part. CONSULTANT may also be declared ineligible for further agreements with
the COMMISSION.
9. HARASSMENT. The COMMISSION maintains a strict policy prohibiting unlawful harassment, including
sexual harassment, in any form, including verbal, physical and visual harassment by any employee,
supervisor, manager, officer or Board member, or agent of the employer. Vendors, CONSULTANTs, and
consultants shall not engage in conduct that has an effect of unreasonably interfering with a COMMISSION
employee's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment.
10. LICENSES. If a license of any kind is required of CONSULTANT, its employees, agents, or sub
CONSULTANTs by Federal or State law, CONSULTANT warrants that such license has been obtained, is
valid and in good standing, that CONSULTANT shall keep it in effect at all times during the terms of this
Agreement, and that any applicable bond has been posted in accordance with all applicable laws and
regulations.
11. INDEPENDENT CONSULTANT STATUS. CONSULTANT and COMMISSION have reviewed and
considered the principal test and secondary factors herein and agree that CONSULTANT is an independent
CONSULTANT and not an employee of COMMISSION. CONSULTANT is responsible for all insurance
(workers compensation, unemployment, etc.) and all payroll related taxes. CONSULTANT is not entitled to
any employee benefits. COMMISSION agrees that CONSULTANT shall have the right to control the
manner and means of accomplishing the result contracted for herein.
PRINCIPAL TEST: The CONSULTANT rather than COMMISSION has the right to control the manner and
means of accomplishing the result contracted for.
SECONDARY FACTORS: (a) The extent of control which, by agreement, COMMISSION may exercise
over the details of the work is slight rather than substantial; (b) CONSULTANT is engaged in a distinct
occupation or business; (c) In the locality, the work to be done by CONSULTANT is usually done by a
specialist without supervision, rather than under the direction of an employer; (d) The skill required in the
particular occupation is substantial rather than slight; (e) The CONSULTANT rather than the COMMISSION
supplies the instrumentalities, tools and work place; (f) The length of time for which CONSULTANT is
engaged is of limited duration rather than indefinite; (g) The method of payment of CONSULTANT is by the
job rather than by the time; (h) The work is part of a special or permissive activity, program, or project, rather
than part of the regular business of COMMISSION; (i) CONSULTANT and COMMISSION believe they are
creating an independent CONSULTANT relationship rather than an employer-employee relationship; and (j)
The COMMISSION conducts public business.
It is recognized that it is not necessary that all secondary factors support creation of an independent
CONSULTANT relationship, but rather that overall there are significant secondary factors which indicate
that CONSULTANT is an independent CONSULTANT.
By their signatures to this Agreement, each of the undersigned certifies that it is his or her considered
judgment that the CONSULTANT engaged under this Agreement is in fact an independent CONSULTANT.
12. RETENTION AND AUDIT OF RECORDS. For the purpose of determining compliance with Public
Contract Code 10115, et seq. and Title 21, California Code of Regulations, Chapter 21, Section 2500 et seq.,

3.2. Supplier shall ensure that its production capacity is and remains sufficient to produce and
supply at least the volume and mix of Products set forth in the Forecast.
3.3. In addition to that supplier confirms a +/- 20% volume flexibility based on PP’s Forecasts. After
a ramp-up period of maximum 1 month, Supplier must be able to increase its production to
maximum capacity. The Supplier understands that volumes ordered by PP completely depend
on PP’s sales volumes. In case of significant changes (> 50 %) to the Forecasts and/or between
the Forecasts and actual orders by PP, the parties will negotiate in good faith price changes to
incorporate the costs, respectively savings directly related to such significant volume changes.
This price adjustment mechanism will not apply in the event a volume price table was agreed
in a Business Agreement. This price adjustment mechanism will be Supplier's sole remedy with
regard to significant volume decreases and the prices can only be increased if PP’s customer
accepts the corresponding price increase of the end products.
3.4. Supplier agrees to provide service parts to PP for a period of 15 years after PP’s ‘End Of

agreed quality standards or with any specification supplied or agreed to by PP, then PP shall
reserve the option to require Supplier to take any of the following steps:
(i) Supplier shall take forthwith all such necessary steps to make any changes, adaptations,
modifications or Improvements required to make the Procedures appropriate and sufficient
and the Products in conformity at Supplier‘s cost; or
(ii) to arrange for such steps to be carried out by a third party if agreed between the Parties.

negotiate in good faith to attempt to resolve the dispute promptly. Supplier’s obligations to
supply the Products shall not be affected by any payments dispute.
8.5. Payment by PP shall not release Supplier from its liability with regard to the Products delivered

claims at a later date.
8.6. The Parties agree to work jointly to improve cost levels. Supplier commits to a yearly a cost
improvement of 3% for the first three years of production.
8.7. The Parties agree to investigate the implementation of a self-billing process and Supplier will at
the request of PP sign a self-billing agreement and fully cooperate with PP to implement such
self-billing process.
8.8. Supplier agrees to, at the request of PP, organise a cost break down workshop together with
PP and/or third party contractors selected by PP, whereby the Parties will investigate means to

Business Agreement or this Framework Agreement if and to the extent such breach results
from a Force Majeure Event.

part of a party’s obligations. A Force Majeure Event does not cover those events which would
render performance of the obligations more difficult, onerous or expensive.
20.4. For clarity, strikes, lockouts or any other labour-related, financial, technical or industrial
incapacity, or any impediment causing a prejudice to the parties, their suppliers and
subcontractors in relation with the deliveries shall not be deemed Force Majeure Events.

described in the above paragraph may not invoke a force majeure exemption prior to informing

liability for any negligent conduct or lack of diligence to remedy the situation or to remove its
cause in a reasonable and adequate manner.

the federal government retains an interest, unless the federal interest in the real property
extends 15 years or longer. In those instances where the federal interest attached is for a period
of 15 years or more, the federal awarding agency or the pass-through entity (RCO), at its option,
may require the Sponsor to report at various multi-year frequencies (e.g., every two years or
every three years, not to exceed a five-year reporting period; or a federal awarding agency or
RCO may require annual reporting for the first three years of a federal award and thereafter
require reporting every five years) (2 C.F.R § 200.329 (2013)).

precedence in the following order:
i. Federal law and binding executive orders;
Page 47 of 50

ii. Code of federal regulations;
iii. Terms and conditions of a grant award to the state from the federal government;
iv. Federal grant program policies and procedures adopted by a federal agency that are
required to be applied by federal law;
v. State Constitution, RCW, and WAC;
vi. Agreement Terms and Conditions and Applicable Manuals

37. LIMITATION OF AUTHORITY.
Only RCO’s Director or RCO’s delegate authorized in writing (delegation to be made prior to action) shall
have the authority to alter, amend, modify, or waive any clause or condition of this Agreement;
provided that any such alteration, amendment, modification, or waiver of any clause or condition of this
Agreement is not effective or binding unless made as a written amendment to this Agreement and
signed by the RCO Director or delegate.
38. WAIVER OF DEFAULT.
Waiver of any default shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any subsequent default. Waiver or breach
of any provision of the Agreement shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any other or subsequent
breach and shall not be construed to be a modification of the terms of the Agreement unless stated to
be such in writing, signed by the director, or the director’s designee, and attached as an amendment to
the original Agreement.
39. APPLICATION REPRESENTATIONS – MISREPRESENTATIONS OR INACCURACY OR BREACH.
The Funding Entity (if different from RCO) and RCO rely on the Sponsor’s application in making its
determinations as to eligibility for, selection for, and scope of, funding grants. Any misrepresentation,
error or inaccuracy in any part of the application may be deemed a breach of this Agreement.
40. SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE.
RCO may enforce this Agreement by the remedy of specific performance, which means Sponsors’
completion of the project and/or its completion of long-term obligations as described in this Agreement.
However, the remedy of specific performance shall not be the sole or exclusive remedy available to RCO.
No remedy available to the RCO shall be deemed exclusive. The RCO may elect to exercise any, a
combination of, or all of the remedies available to it under this Agreement, or under any provision of
law, common law, or equity, including but not limited to seeking full or partial repayment of the grant
amount paid and damages.
41. TERMINATION AND SUSPENSION.
a. The RCO requires strict compliance by the Sponsor with all the terms of this Agreement
including, but not limited to, the requirements of the applicable statutes, rules, and RCO
policies, and with the representations of the Sponsor in its application for a grant as finally
approved by RCO. For federal awards, notification of termination will comply with 2 C.F.R. §
200.340.
b. For Cause.
Page 48 of 50
2020 RCO GRANT AGREEMENT
i. The RCO director may suspend or terminate the obligation to provide funding to the
Sponsor under this Agreement:
a. If the Sponsor breaches any of the Sponsor's obligations under this Agreement;
b. If the Sponsor fails to make progress satisfactory to the RCO director toward
completion of the project by the completion date set out in this Agreement.
Included in progress is adherence to milestones and other defined deadlines; or
c. If the primary and secondary Sponsor(s) cannot mutually agree on the process and
actions needed to implement the project;
d. Prior to termination, the RCO shall notify the Sponsor in writing of the opportunity
to cure. If corrective action is not taken within 30 days or such other time period
that the director approves in writing, the Agreement may be terminated. In the
event of termination, the Sponsor shall be liable for damages or other relief as
authorized by law and/or this Agreement.
ii. RCO reserves the right to suspend all or part of the Agreement, withhold further payments,
or prohibit the Sponsor from incurring additional obligations of funds during the
investigation of any alleged breach and pending corrective action by the Sponsor, or a
decision by the RCO to terminate the Contract.
c. For Convenience. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, RCO may, by ten (10) days
written notice, beginning on the second day after the mailing, terminate this Agreement, in
whole or in part when it is in the best interest of the state. If this Agreement is so terminated,
RCO shall be liable only for payment required under the terms of this Agreement prior to the
effective date of termination. A claimed termination for cause shall be deemed to be a
"Termination for Convenience" if it is determined that:
i. The Sponsor was not in default; or
ii. Failure to perform was outside Sponsor’s control, fault or negligence.
d. Rights of Remedies of the RCO.
i. The rights and remedies of RCO provided in this Agreement are not exclusive and are in
addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law.
ii. In the event this Agreement is terminated by the director, after any portion of the grant
amount has been paid to the Sponsor under this Agreement , the director may require that
any amount paid be repaid to RCO for redeposit into the account from which the funds were
derived. However, any repayment shall be limited to the extent it would be inequitable and
represent a manifest injustice in circumstances where the project will fulfill its fundamental
purpose for substantially the entire period of performance and of long-term obligation.
iii. Non-Availability of Funds. The obligation of the RCO to make payments is contingent on the
availability of state and federal funds through legislative appropriation and state allotment.
If amounts sufficient to fund the grant made under this Agreement are not appropriated to
RCO for expenditure for this Agreement in any biennial fiscal period, RCO shall not be
obligated to pay any remaining unpaid portion of this grant unless and until the necessary
action by the Legislature or the Office of Financial Management occurs. If RCO participation
Page 49 of 50
2020 RCO GRANT AGREEMENT
is suspended under this section for a continuous period of one year, RCO’s obligation to
provide any future funding under this Agreement shall terminate. Termination of the
Agreement under this section is not subject to appeal by the Sponsor.
iv. Suspension: The obligation of the RCO to manage contract terms and make payments is
contingent upon the state appropriating state and federal funding each biennium. In the
event the state is unable to appropriate such funds by the first day of each new biennium
RCO reserves the right to suspend the Agreement, with ten (10) days written notice, until
such time funds are appropriated. Suspension will mean all work related to the contract
must cease until such time funds are obligated to RCO and the RCO provides notice to
continue work.
v. No Waiver. The failure or neglect of RCO to require strict compliance with any term of this
Agreement or to pursue a remedy provided by this Agreement or by law shall not act as or
be construed as a waiver of any right to fully enforce all rights and obligations set forth in
this Agreement and in applicable state or federal law and regulations.
42. DISPUTE HEARING.
a. Except as may otherwise be provided in this Agreement , when a dispute arises between the
Sponsor and the RCO, which cannot be resolved, either party may request a dispute hearing
according to the process set out in this section. Either party’s request for a dispute hearing must
be in writing and clearly state:
i. The disputed issues;
ii. The relative positions of the parties;
iii. The Sponsor’s name, address, project title, and the assigned project number.
b. In order for this section to apply to the resolution of any specific dispute or disputes, the other
party must agree in writing that the procedure under this section shall be used to resolve those
specific issues. The dispute shall be heard by a panel of three persons consisting of one person
chosen by the Sponsor, one person chosen by the director, and a third person chosen by the
two persons initially appointed. If a third person cannot be agreed on, the persons chosen by
the Sponsor and director shall be dismissed and an alternate person chosen by the Sponsor, and
one by the director shall be appointed and they shall agree on a third person. This process shall
be repeated until a three person panel is established.
c. Any hearing under this section shall be informal, with the specific processes to be determined by
the disputes panel according to the nature and complexity of the issues involved. The process
may be solely based on written material if the parties so agree. The disputes panel shall be
governed by the provisions of this Agreement in deciding the disputes.
d. The parties shall be bound by the majority decision of the dispute panelists, unless the remedy
directed by that panel is beyond the authority of either or both parties to perform, as necessary,
or is otherwise unlawful.
Page 50 of 50
2020 RCO GRANT AGREEMENT
e. Request for a disputes hearing under this section by either party shall be delivered or mailed to
the other party. The request shall be delivered or mailed within thirty (30) days of the date the
requesting party has received notice of the action or position of the other party which it wishes
to dispute. The written agreement to use the process under this section for resolution of those
issues shall be delivered or mailed by the receiving party to the requesting party within thirty
(30) days of receipt by the receiving party of the request.
f. All costs associated with the implementation of this process shall be shared equally by the
parties.
43. ATTORNEYS’ FEES.
In the event of litigation or other action brought to enforce the terms of this Agreement each party
agrees to bear its own attorney fees and costs.
44. GOVERNING LAW/VENUE.
This Agreement shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of
Washington. In the event of a lawsuit involving this Agreement, venue shall be in Thurston County
Superior Court if legally proper; otherwise venue shall be in the Superior Court of a county where the
project is situated, if venue there is legally proper, and if not, in a county where venue is legally proper.
The Sponsor, by execution of this Agreement acknowledges the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of
Washington.
45. SEVERABILITY.
The provisions of this Agreement are intended to be severable. If any term or provision is illegal or
invalid for any reason whatsoever, such illegality or invalidity shall not affect the validity of the
remainder of the Agreement.
46. END OF AGREEMENT.
This is the end of the agreement.

BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP AGREEMENT
THIS BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”) is made by and between EFL
Holdings Tech B.V., a Netherlands corporation (“EFL”), and Oryon Technologies, Inc., a Nevada, U.S.A.
corporation (“Oryon”). As used herein, EFL and Oryon are each referred to as, a “Party” and collectively, the
“Parties.” Capitalized terms used herein and not defined shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the
Subscription Agreement (as defined below).
WITNESSETH
WHEREAS, pursuant to a subscription agreement (the “Subscription Agreement”), dated as of the
same date herewith, by and between an affiliate of EFL and Oryon, Oryon will issue and sell to such affiliate
and such affiliate will purchase the Subscription Securities;
WHEREAS, in connection with the transaction involving the Subscription Securities and as a portion of
the consideration for the acquisition of the Subscription Securities, EFL and Oryon desire to enter into this
Agreement to establish the terms and conditions under which EFL will engage in the Business during the term
of this Agreement; and
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises herein contained, the Parties hereto agree
as follows:
1. Definitions. In addition to the terms defined elsewhere in this Agreement, the following
terms have the meanings, for purposes of this Agreement, set forth in this Section 1:
(a) “Closing” shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in Section 2.3 of the
Subscription Agreement.
(b) “Closing Date” shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in Section 2.3 of the
Subscription Agreement.
(c) “EL” has the meaning set forth in the License.
(d) “License” shall mean the License Agreement between EFL, as licensor, and Oryon,
as licensee, entered into on the Closing Date pursuant to which Licensor has licensed certain intellectual
property rights for use in the Business (as defined below), as such agreement may be amended from time to
time.
(e) “Licensed Product” has the meaning set forth in the License.
(f) “Person” means an individual or corporation, partnership, trust, incorporated or
unincorporated association, joint venture, limited liability company, joint stock company, government (or an
agency or subdivision thereof) or other entity of any kind.

and conditions contained herein, EFL agrees that it will not, directly or indirectly, provide services to or
otherwise engage in the business of manufacturing, designing, marketing, selling or distributing EL and
Licensed Products (the “Business”), other than through the ownership, management and control of Oryon by
an affiliate of EFL. This Agreement shall not restrict EFL from acquiring equity interests in any Person,
including any Person that is engaged in the Business.

EFL/Oryon 1
3. Management of the Business. During the term hereof, but subject to the other terms and
provisions hereof:
(a) EFL agrees to refer all business and other commercial opportunities related to the
Business (“Opportunities”) which it develops or discovers, or which otherwise come to its attention, to Oryon
to be pursued and managed.
(b) Oryon shall review and consider the Opportunities referred to it by EFL, together
with the Opportunities which it develops or discovers, or which otherwise come to its attention, and shall
pursue those Opportunities which it determines to be appropriate and in the best interests of furthering the
Business.
(c) EFL may provide various services to Oryon in connection with Oryon’s management
of the Business, including, but not limited to, the following (collectively, the “Services”):
(i) development of, introduction to, and negotiations with customers, manufacturers,
suppliers, distributors and licensees, including companies involved in the manufacture of EL,
the assembly of EL onto apparel, molded products and other items, and the distribution and
sale of EL products;

(v) market development.
4. Compensation of EFL. The Parties contemplate that the Services to be provided to Oryon
by EFL in accordance with Section 3 above will be varied and wide-ranging, will occur over a lengthy time
period, and will take place throughout the world. Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge and agree that it is not
prudent to specify in detail the precise formula, framework, or amount of compensation that Oryon will pay to
EFL for each Service rendered to it, or on its behalf, by EFL. The Parties therefore agree that EFL and Oryon
will negotiate in good faith with respect to the compensation Oryon will pay to EFL for each Service provided
by EFL, it being the intent of the Parties that Oryon will pay compensation to EFL that is commercially
reasonable, and that takes into consideration the business experience and infrastructure, scientific and
technical expertise, consulting experience, research and development expertise, business contacts and
relationships throughout the world, and other professional capabilities of EFL. Oryon will pay all invoices
submitted by EFL pursuant to specific agreements that are negotiated between the Parties with respect to
specific Services in accordance with the terms of such agreements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties
agree and acknowledge that EFL shall have no obligation to provide the Services (and no liability should it fail
or refuse to provide the Services) until and unless the Parties agree in writing to the compensation to be
received by EFL for the Services. In connection with negotiating such compensation package, Oryon
acknowledges and agrees that EFL may also negotiate for and demand other terms and provisions including,
but not limited to, those relating to indemnity, limitation of liability, insurance, term and termination, standards
of service and otherwise.

Explanatory notes for the Mediator concerning the settlement agreement
The Settlement Agreement
1. Mediators are not encouraged to participate in assisting the parties to draft
their settlement agreement. This is even more true of the RICS Mediator who may
not have a legal background, even though he or she may be experienced in the type
of dispute being mediated. In particular the drafting of a settlement agreement by the
Mediator is likely to be the one activity in respect of which an action in negligence
may lie if he or she gets it wrong. Mediators should therefore generally not participate
in drafting the settlement where the parties have legal representation, or at least one
side has a lawyer competent to draft the agreement. If that is not the case the
Mediator should encourage the parties either to settle the agreement themselves, at
least as heads of agreement, and have a lawyer provide such additional detail as is
necessary. If unrepresented parties require you to help draft the agreement the
following general principles apply.
2. It is essential that the parties secure a concluded agreement that is workable,
comprehensive, (both as to the dispute and any wider issues which have been
introduced,) and enforceable. It is vital that the parties, usually through their lawyers,
get the form of the agreement right, to ensure that the settlement is enforceable. The
terms must be certain, specific, effective, practical and complete, in particular dealing
with who is to do what, when, and with what precise consequences.
3. Consider whether a provision will need to be inserted detailing with what to do
if one side or the other fails to adhere to the agreement or if it proves to be
unworkable. While such clarity is desirable, it may deflate the atmosphere of
successful compromise, and care needs to be taken.
4. The Mediator may suggest in advance that the lead representative on each
side should take a draft containing the likely heads of agreement with him or her,
and, if litigation is running, a general form of Tomlin order. If the compromise
contains terms found in a recognised standard form or precedent it needs to be
brought with otherwise a party will be forced to locate it, possibly out of business
hours, and probably at a highly inconvenient time for doing so.
5. As settlement nears the representative should begin to draft the proposed
agreement in the caucus room. The Mediator will encourage a discussion of the
structure, form and contents with the client as early as possible, since this can be
done as the mediation progresses and will help focus on the details. It places the
client’s personal agenda in context and gives focus to the practicalities of its
implementation.
6. If you are asked to draft the settlement agreement by unrepresented parties
be careful to strike a balance between too little, and too much detail. Do not be overly
pedantic. Remember it is likely to be either quite late or very late, at the end of a long
day. While the document is being settled you should ask the decision maker in each
party precisely who should be the signatory, and whether they have authority.
You may wish to consider the introduction of certain standard clauses irrespective of
the nature of the settlement. These should deal with:-
• confidentiality
• any relevant choice of law or jurisdiction
• that this is the entire agreement between the parties
• a default mechanism to deal with future disputes
• whether, if there is a breach of this agreement, the original cause of action
should be reinstated (the opposite of the standard Tomlin order).
The settlement-specific clauses need to be certain as to:-
• payment: who pays, to whom is payment made, and how much
• the form in which payment is to be made
• whether payment is to be immediate or in stages
• the mechanism for default of payment
• the provision of interest
• the costs of the litigation
• the costs of the mediation
• any public statements
• the discontinuance or withdrawal of proceedings
• any special clauses dealing with enforceability
• who is the signatory, his or her status or authority.
7. There will be occasions when the parties can do no more than agree outline
heads of agreement, but this should be avoided wherever possible. Saving an hour
at the end of the mediation by agreeing only outline heads of agreement exposes the
parties to the risk of further disputes in which the argument shifts from its original
subject matter to contesting what has been agreed. It is essential that the intention of
the parties is made plain, and there is at least sufficient detail to ensure that an
impartial reader would have a clear idea of precisely what has been agreed. If there
is no time to put in the complexity of the mechanics of the transaction, or, for
example, the tax implications have not been advised upon or worked out, at least
draw a distinction between the agreement itself and the mechanics for performing it.
Explanatory notes for the user of the settlement agreement (i.e. unrepresented
parties)
The Settlement Agreement
1. Mediators are not encouraged to participate in assisting the parties to draft
their settlement agreement. Your RICS Mediator may not have a legal background,
even though he or she will be experienced in the type of dispute being mediated.
RICS Mediators will therefore generally not participate in drafting the settlement
where you or the other party has legal representation. If that is not the case the
Mediator will encourage you either to settle the agreement yourselves, or at least the
heads of agreement, and then have a lawyer provide such additional detail as is
necessary.
2. It is essential that you secure a concluded agreement with the other party or
parties that is workable, comprehensive, (both as to the dispute and any wider issues
which have been introduced,) and enforceable. It is vital that the parties, usually
through their lawyers, get the form of the agreement right, to ensure that the
settlement is enforceable. The terms must be certain, specific, effective, practical and
complete, in particular dealing with who is to do what, when, and with what precise
consequences should that party fail to do what it has agreed. Normally such
agreements are reduced to writing at the conclusion of the mediation since, although
you may aftewards have some reservations about what was agreed, and you may
wish to build in a ‘cooling-off’ period prior to the agreement taking effect, it is
important that you are not influenced by someone who was not at the mediation and
did not see what happened to enable the parties to agree.
3. Consider whether a provision will need to be inserted detailing with what to do
if one fails to adhere to the agreement or if it proves to be unworkable.
4. The Mediator may suggest in advance that the lead representative on each
side should take a draft containing the likely heads of agreement with him or her,
and, if litigation is running, a general form of Tomlin order which deals with the
completion of any court proceedings. If the compromise contains terms found in a
recognised standard form or precedent used by lawyers in such cases, it needs to be
brought to the mediation otherwise you may be forced to locate it, possibly out of
business hours, and probably at a highly inconvenient time for doing so.
5. As settlement nears, your lawyer or representative may begin to draft the
proposed agreement in the caucus room. The Mediator will encourage a discussion
of the structure, form and contents with you as early as possible, since this can be
done as the mediation progresses and will help focus your mind on the details, place
your personal agenda in context and deal with the practicalities of its implementation.
6. Your settlement agreement needs to strike a balance between too little, and
too much detail. You should understand it. Remember it is likely to be either quite
late or very late, at the end of a long day. Please ensure that the signatory, if not you,
has authority to sign.
There may be certain standard clauses irrespective of the nature of the settlement.
These should deal with:-
• confidentiality
• any relevant choice of law or jurisdiction
• that this is the entire agreement between the parties
• a default mechanism to deal with future disputes
• whether, if there is a breach of this agreement, the original cause of action
should be reinstated (the opposite of the standard Tomlin order).
The settlement-specific clauses need to be certain as to:-
• payment: who pays, to whom is payment made, and how much
• the form in which payment is to be made
• whether payment is to be immediate or in stages
• the mechanism for default of payment
• the provision of interest
• the costs of the litigation
• the costs of the mediation
• any public statements
• the discontinuance or withdrawal of proceedings
• any special clauses dealing with enforceability
• who is the signatory, his or her status or authority.
7. There will be occasions when you can do no more than agree outline heads
of agreement, but this should be avoided wherever possible. Saving an hour at the
end of the mediation by agreeing only outline heads of agreement exposes you to the
risk of further disputes in which the argument shifts from its original subject matter to
contesting what has been agreed. It is essential that the intention of you and the
other party/parties is made plain, and there is at least sufficient detail to ensure that
an impartial reader would have a clear idea of precisely what has been agreed. If
there is no time to put in the complexity of the mechanics of the transaction, or, for
example, the tax implications have not been advised upon or worked out, at least
draw a distinction between the agreement itself and the mechanics for performing it.
A NOTE ON THE TEXT
The purpose of this information pack is twofold: to provide lay and professional
clients details of what they can expect from RICS Mediators; and to offer such
mediators practical guidance where necessary to help draft agreements in clear
English as part of the RICS Mediation process. The standard forms offered are by
way of suggestion, since they can not be a panacea for all drafting problems you may
encounter in preparing for or settling a mediation. Drafting well comes only with
practice, thought and experience rather than being taught. The contents of this pack
offers ideas for best practice to achieve clarity and certainty, and for lay parties to
have consistency in the approach offered by RICS Mediators.
By drafting we mean the composition of legal documents, be they contracts,
settlements or any other piece writing with a legal content or for a legal purpose. It is
a special written word skill.
The RICS Mediator will usually not be a lawyer, but like a lawyer will have to apply
the law and legal principles when drafting agreements and other similar documents
and must achieve legal certainty - which may mean using legal words and phrases
that are best avoided in general writing. Lay parties need to be aware when you are
composing legal documents, you cannot write as you would in an everyday letter or
an opinion. Every word counts, every word must be chosen with care, every phrase
must be apt, every sentence must be immaculately constructed. This means there
will be less fluency in the writing process: drafting involves trial and error, chopping
and changing until you feel what you have is right.
.
The effectiveness of a legal document depends on a number of factors, some large
and others by comparison insignificant. All are worthy of attention. It is the
combination of them all which produces the effect we want. With habit, these factors
become embedded and natural.
USING CLEAR ENGLISH
There are a number of compelling reasons why legal documents should be written in
clear (sometimes called Plain) English.
1. Professionalism
• RICS is a professional organisation that is correctly judged on the clarity of what we
write. We have a professional responsibility to use clear English in the parties’
interests .
2. Image
• We are seen as what we write. Lazy, clumsy, muddled or old fashioned writing
suggests a lazy, clumsy, muddled or old fashioned writer.
• Clients and business contacts do not like to spend time and money interpreting (or
asking us to interpret) a badly written document, or to find out later that it didn't mean
what they (and the writer) thought it meant. Mediation should solve problems, not
create more by using sloppy documentation.
• Good content loses much of its effect if it is poorly presented.
3. Using Language as a Precision Tool
Legal writing is stuffy, pompous, wordy, artificial, often ungrammatical, jargon-filled,
and pretentious. And bad writing makes the reader’s job harder. So, why make your
task more difficult by failing to use plain language? Avoid any word that does not
command instant understanding - you need to let the reader see your ideas without
struggling to grasp your meaning. Sentences should be constructed so the reader
may read with understanding effortlessly. You are aiming to produce a document that
is clear, precise, unambiguous, comprehensible and complete. In addition it should
contain no errors of spelling, punctuation, grammar or syntax, and cause no difficulty
to those who have learned English as a foreign language. Professionals should know
how to use English properly; and be able to spell.
4. Efficiency
• A reader should be able to understand what is written at the first reading. This is
especially important with shorter documents, and much easier to achieve if the writer
takes care with what they write. If you spend time to write clearly, you will save your
reader's time in understanding what you have written.
• Clear English drafting is easier to amend accurately - especially in negotiations
when under pressure.
5. Market demand
(a) Clear English is increasingly being used in the business and legal worlds:
• The Plain English Campaign has resulted in a substantial increase in the
preparation of plain English documents by, for example, banks and insurers for their
retail and consumer businesses (including a number of our clients).
• The Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 require consumer
contracts to be written in plain and intelligible language and to be accessible in
design and layout. If there is any doubt over the meaning of a consumer contract it is
interpreted in the way which is most favourable to the consumer.
• The Office of Fair Trading promotes changes in unclear terms in consumer
contracts and the removal of unnecessary or pointless language. Similar
requirements apply throughout the EU.
• The Civil Procedure Rules encourage the use of plain English in drafting statements
of case (which used to be called "pleadings").
• The European Parliament, Commission and Council adopted an Inter-institutional
Agreement in 1998. This provides that Community legislative acts must be drafted
"clearly, simply and precisely".
(b) English is the common language for many cross border transactions and
correspondence; it is in particular the global language of technology. If we write and
speak in clear English we increase the mutual understanding between native and
non native English speakers (whether they are lay parties or their professional
advisers). It also makes translation easier.
