Annexure A
Policy on Collection of Dues and Repossession of Security
1. Introduction:
The debt collection policy of the Bank is built around dignity and respect to customers. Bank will not follow
policies that are unduly coercive in collection of dues. The policy is built on courtesy, fair treatment and
persuasion. The Bank believes in following fair practices with regard to collection of dues and repossession
of security and thereby fostering customer confidence and long-term relationship.
The repayment schedule for any loan sanctioned by the Bank will be fixed taking into account paying
capacity and cash flow pattern of the borrower. The Bank will explain to the customer upfront the method
of calculation of interest and how the Equated Monthly Installments (EMI) or payments through any other
mode of repayment will be appropriated against interest and principal due from the customers. The Bank
would expect the customers to adhere to the repayment schedule agreed to and approach the Bank for
assistance and guidance in case of genuine difficulty in meeting repayment obligations.
Bank’s Security Repossession Policy aims at recovery of dues in the event of default and is not aimed
at whimsical deprivation of the property. The policy recognises fairness and transparency in repossession,
valuation and realisation of security. All the practices adopted by the Bank for follow up and recovery of
dues and repossession of security will be in consonance with the law.
2. General Guidelines:
All the members of the staff or any person authorised to represent our Bank in collection or/ and security
repossession would follow the guidelines set out below:
(i) The customer would be contacted ordinarily at the place of his/ her choice and in the absence
of any specified place, at the place of his/ her residence and if unavailable at his/ her residence, at
the place of business/ occupation.
(ii) Identity and authority of persons authorised to represent Bank for follow up and recovery of dues
would be made known to the borrowers at the first instance. The Bank staff or any person
authorised to represent the Bank in collection of dues or/ and security repossession will identify
himself/ herself and display the authority letter issued by the Bank upon request.
(iii) The Bank would respect privacy of its borrowers.
(iv) The Bank is committed to ensure that all written and verbal communication with its borrowers will
be in simple business language and Bank will adopt civil manners for interaction with borrowers.
(v) Normally the Bank’s representatives will contact the borrower between 0700 hrs and 1900 hrs,
unless the special circumstance of his/ her business or occupation requires the Bank to contact at a
different time.
(vi) Borrower’s requests to avoid calls at a particular time or at a particular place would be honored as
far as possible.
(vii) The Bank will document the efforts made for the recovery of dues and the copies of communication
set to customers, if any, will be kept on record.
(viii) All assistance will be given to resolve disputes or differences regarding dues in a mutually
acceptable and in an orderly manner.
(ix) Inappropriate occasions such as bereavement in the family or such other calamitous occasions will
be avoided for making calls/ visits to collect dues.
3. Giving Notice To Borrowers
While written communications, telephonic reminders or visits by the Bank’s representatives to the
borrowers place or residence will be used as loan follow up measures, the Bank will not initiate any legal
or other recovery measures including repossession of the security without giving due notice in writing.
Bank will follow all such procedures as required under law for recovery/ repossession of security.
4. Repossession of Security
Repossession of security is aimed at recovery of dues and not to deprive the borrower of the property. The
recovery process through repossession of security will involve repossession, valuation of security and
realisation of security through appropriate means. All these would be carried out in a fair and transparent
manner. Repossession will be done only after issuing the notice as detailed above. Due process of law
will be followed while taking repossession of the property. The Bank will take all reasonable care for
ensuring the safety and security of the property after taking custody, in the ordinary course of the
business.
5. Valuation and Sale of Property
Valuation and sale of property repossessed by the Bank will be carried out as per law and in a fair and
transparent manner. The Bank will have right to recover from the borrower the balance due if any, after sale
of property. Excess amount if any, obtained on sale of property will be returned to the borrower after
meeting all the related expenses provided the Bank is not having any other claims against the customer.
Where the Borrower is registered under GST law, the Borrower shall ensure that all the provisions, of the
GST law, including any rules/ regulations or any amendments thereto are adhered to and complied with
by the Borrower. In case where the Borrower is not registered under the GST, the Borrowers shall submit
the documents in support of the purchase price of the hypothecated goods.
The Borrower shall continue to be responsible towards the withholding tax under the Income Tax Act,
1961 on disposal of the hypothecated goods.
6. Repossession of Security
As indicated earlier in the policy document, the Bank will resort to repossession of security only for the
purpose of realisation of its dues as the last resort and not with intention of depriving the borrower of the
property. Accordingly the Bank will be willing to consider handing over possession of property to the
borrower any time after repossession and before concluding sale transaction of the property, provided the
Bank dues are cleared in full. If satisfied with the genuineness of borrower’s inability to pay the loan
installments as per the schedule which resulted in the repossession of security, the Bank may consider
handing over the property after receiving the installments in arrears. However, this would be subject to
the Bank being convinced of the arrangements made by the borrower to ensure timely repayment of
remaining installments in future.

To:
The Manager,
Deutsche Bank
__________________________ branch
Dear Sir,
With reference to the Credit facilities sanctioned to me/us vide sanction Letter ref No _______________
Dated ____________________, and being availed by us today, I/ we confirm having understood the following
concepts and illustrative examples related to due dates, classification of our borrowal accounts as SMA / NPA in
the course of the conduct of the accounts.
Concepts/ clarifications/ Illustrative examples on Due dates and specification of SMA/ NPA classification dates:
Dues:
mean, the principal /interest/any charges levied on the loan account which are payable within the period
stipulated as per the terms of sanction of the credit facility.
Overdue:
mean, the principal/ interest/ any charges levied on the loan account which are payable, but have not been
paid within the period stipulated as per the terms of sanction of the credit facility. In other words, any
amount due to the bank under any credit facility is ‘overdue’ if it is not paid on the due date fixed by
the bank.
Relevance of the Principle of ‘First In First Out’ (FIFO) in appropriation of payments into the borrowal account:
The Principle of FIFO i.e., ‘First In, First Out’ accounting method is relevant to arrive at the No. of days of overdue
for determining the SMA/ NPA status. The FIFO principle assumes that the oldest outstanding dues in the loan
account needs to be cleared first. The FIFO method thus requires that what is due first must be paid by the
borrower first. For example:
if in any loan account as on 01.02.2021 there are no overdues and an amount of Rs.X is due for payment
towards principal instalment/ interest/ charges, any payment being credited on or after 01.02.2021 in the
loan account will be used to pay off the dues outstanding on 01.02.2021.
Assuming that nothing is paid /or there is partial payment (Rs Y) of dues during the month of February, the
overdue as on 01.03.2021 will be Rs. X-Y.
Additionally, an amount of Rs. Z becomes due as on 01.03.2021, Now any payment /partial payment into
the account on or after 01.03.2021 will be first utilized to pay off the partial due of 01.02.2021 (Rs X - Rs. Y)
If there is more recovery than the Rs X - Rs Y. then after recovering dues of 01.02.2021, the remaining
amount will be treated as recovery towards due of 01.03.2021.
Age of oldest Dues:
The age of oldest dues is reckoned in days from the date on which the oldest payment is due and continues to
remain unpaid. In the aforesaid illustration, if the Dues relating to 1st February 2021 remain unpaid till 01.03 2021,
the age of the oldest dues is reckoned as 29 days on 02.03.2021.
32Signature of Borrower(s) [X]
Classification as Special Mention Account (SMA) and Non-Performing Asset (NPA)
Lending institutions will recognise the incipient stress in loan accounts, immediately on Default, by classifying them
as Special Mention Accounts (SMA) The basis of classification of SMA/ NPA Category shall be as follows:
However, In case of NBFCs, the reference to 90 days for SMA-2 / NPA classification to be read as per the
applicable norms and also subject to the provisions of the RB I Circular DOR CRE.REC .No.60/03.10.001/2021- 22
dated October 22,2021 on ‘Scale Based Regulation (SBR): A revised Regulatory framework for NBFCs. Also the
asset classification norms of Agricultural advances which are based on Crop Season shall continue as hitherto.
Non-performing Asset:
Non-Performing Asset (NPA) is a loan or an advance where:
i. interest and/ or instalment of principal remains overdue for a period of more than 90 days in respect of a
term loan,
ii. the account remains ‘out of order’ as indicated below, in respect of an Overdraft/ Cash Credit (OD/ CC),
iii. the bill remains overdue for a period of more than 90 days in the case of bills purchased and discounted,
iv. the instalment of principal or interest thereon remains overdue for two crop seasons for short duration
crops,
v. the instalment of principal or interest thereon remains overdue for one crop season for long duration
crops.
‘Out of Order’ Status:
An account shall be treated as ‘out of order’ if:
i. the outstanding balance in the CC/ OD account remains continuously in excess of the sanctioned limit/
drawing power for 90 days, or
ii. the outstanding balance in the CC/ OD account is less than the sanctioned limit/drawing power but
there are no credits continuously for 90 days, or the outstanding balance in the CC/ OD account is less
than the sanctioned limit/ drawing power but credits are not enough to cover the interest debited during
the previous 90 days period.

or in connection with this Agreement constitute or, if not yet executed or delivered, will
when so executed and delivered constitute, legal, valid and binding obligations of
Borrower enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with their respective terms.
(e) No Breach of Law or Agreement. Neither the execution nor delivery of
this Agreement and the Loan Documents or of any other documents or instruments

will conflict with or result in a breach of any statute, rule or regulation, or any judgment,2023 Supportive Housing NOFA Amendment

decree or order of any court, board, commission or agency whatsoever binding on
Borrower and in effect at the time of execution of this Agreement, or any provision of the
organizational documents of Borrower or, if applicable, of its constituent partners, or will
conflict with or constitute a breach of or a default under any agreement to which
Borrower, or, if applicable, its constituent partners, is a party, or will result in the creation
or imposition of any lien upon any assets or property of Borrower, other than liens estab-
lished pursuant hereto.
(f) Pending Proceedings. Borrower is not in default under any law or
regulation or under any order of any court, board, commission or agency whatsoever, and
there are no claims, actions, suits or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of
Borrower, threatened against Borrower or the Property or Project, at law or in equity,
before or by any court, board, commission or agency whatsoever which might, if
determined adversely to Borrower, materially affect Borrower's ability to repay the Loan
or impair the security to be given to the County pursuant hereto.
(g) Compliance with Laws; Consents and Approvals. The Project shall
comply at all times with all applicable laws (including but not limited to all Hazardous
Substances Laws), ordinances, rules and regulations of federal, state, and local govern-
ments and agencies, and with all applicable directions, rules and regulations of the fire
marshal, health officer, building inspector, and other officers of any such government or
agency. All consents, permissions and licenses required by any federal, state, or local
government or agency to which the Borrower, the Property or the Project is subject,
which may be necessary in relation to this Agreement or the ownership or operation of
the Project, have been or will be obtained.
(h) Financial Statements. The financial statements of the Borrower and its
constituent partners, if any, and other financial data and information furnished by the
Borrower for review by the County relating to the financial condition of Borrower or any
of Borrower’s constituent partners or the Project, fairly present the information contained
therein. As of the date of Loan disbursement, there will not have been any adverse
material change in the financial condition of the Borrower or its constituent partners from
that shown by such financial statements and other data and information.
(i) Adequacy of Loan. The amount of the Loan, together with any funds to
be provided by the Borrower or to the Borrower from any other sources, is adequate to
pay all costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of the Property and to enable the
Borrower to satisfy the covenants contained in this Agreement.
(j) Payment of Taxes. All federal, state, county, and municipal taxes required
to be paid by the Borrower or on account of the Property have been paid in full as of the
date of this Agreement or will be paid in full by the Close of Escrow. Borrower knows of
no basis for any additional assessment of taxes as of this date.
(k) Regulatory Agreement. The Project is, and will at all times remain, in
compliance with all requirements of this Agreement and the Regulatory Agreement. The2023 Supportive Housing NOFA Amendment

laws and the Regulatory Agreement.
ARTICLE VII
CONTINUING OBLIGATIONS OF BORROWER
7.1 Applicability. For the longer of the entire Term, or so long as the Note
remains outstanding, the Borrower shall comply with the provisions of this Article VII.
7.2 Compliance with Loan Documents. Borrower shall promptly comply with
all the terms, covenants and provisions of the Loan Documents.
7.3 Taxes and Assessments. So long as Borrower owns the Property and the
Project, Borrower shall pay all real and personal property taxes, assessments and charges,
and all franchise, income, unemployment, old age benefit, withholding, sales, and other
taxes assessed against it, or payable by it, at such times and in such manner as to prevent
any delinquency or penalty from accruing, or any lien or charge from attaching to the
Project; provided, however, that Borrower shall have the right to contest in good faith any
such taxes, assessments, or charges. In the event Borrower exercises its right to contest
any tax, assessment, or charge against it, Borrower, on final determination of the
proceeding or contest, shall immediately pay or discharge any decision or judgment
rendered against it, together with all costs, charges, and interest.
7.4 Indemnity.
(a) To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Borrower agrees to indemnify,
hold harmless and defend the County and its elected officials, officers, governing
members, employees, attorneys and agents (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties"), from
and against any and all losses, damages, claims, actions, liabilities, reasonable costs and
expenses of any and every conceivable nature, kind or character (including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees, litigation and court costs, amounts paid in
settlement and amounts paid to discharge judgments) to which the Indemnified Parties, or
any of them, may become subject to under any statutory law (including federal or state
securities laws) or at common law or otherwise, arising out of or based upon or in any
way relating to:
1. the Loan Documents or the execution or amendment thereof or in
connection with the transactions contemplated thereby;
2. Borrower’s ownership or operation of the Project or any act or
omission of the Borrower or any of its agents, contractors, servants, employees or
licensees in connection with the Loan or the Project, the operation of the Project, or the
condition, environmental or otherwise, occupancy, use, possession, conduct or2023 Supportive Housing NOFA Amendment

ATTACHMENT N 1
[ ] – County Loan Agreement 16
management of work done in or about, or from the planning, design, acquisition,
installation, operation or rehabilitation of, the Project or any part thereof;
3. any lien or charge upon payments by the Borrower to the
County, or any taxes (including, without limitation, all ad valorem taxes and sales taxes),
assessments, impositions and other charges imposed on the County in respect
of any portion of the Project;
4. any violation of any environmental law, rule or regulation with
respect to, or the release of any toxic substance from, the Project or any part thereof;
5. any untrue statement or misleading statement or alleged untrue
statement or alleged misleading statement of a material fact by the Borrower contained in
any Loan Document or any of the documents or instruments relating to said Loan
Documents that the County relied upon in making the Loan except to the extent such
damages are caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified
Party. In the event that any action or proceeding is brought against any Indemnified Party
with respect to which indemnity may be sought hereunder, the Borrower, upon written
notice from the Indemnified Party, shall assume the investigation and defense thereof,
including the employment and payment for counsel selected by the Indemnified Party,
and shall assume the payment of all reasonable expenses related thereto, with full power
to litigate, compromise or settle the same; provided that the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to review and approve or disapprove any such compromise or settlement.
6. If judgment is entered against Borrower and County by a court of
competent jurisdiction because of the concurrent active negligence of County or
Indemnified Parties, Borrower and County agree that liability will be apportioned as
determined by the court. Neither Party shall request a jury apportionment.
7.5 Entry by the County. Borrower shall permit the County, through its
officers, agents, or employees, at all reasonable times to enter into or onto the Property or
the Project and inspect the Project to determine that the same is in conformity with the
Loan Documents and all the requirements hereof. Borrower acknowledges that the
County is under no obligation to supervise, inspect, or inform Borrower of the results of
its said inspection(s) and Borrower shall not rely upon the County therefor. Any
inspection by the County is entirely for its purposes in determining whether Borrower is
in default under this Agreement or the Loan Documents. Borrower shall rely entirely
upon its own supervision and inspection.
7.6 Hazardous Materials. Borrower shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the County, and its respective elected and appointed officials, members,
directors, officers, employees, agents, successors and assigns from and against any loss,
damage, cost, expense or liability directly or indirectly arising out of or attributable to the
use, generation, storage, release, threatened release, discharge, disposal, or presence of
hazardous materials on, under, or about the Project, including without limitation: (a) all
foreseeable consequential damages; (b) the costs of any required or necessary repair,2023 Supportive Housing NOFA Amendment
OC Housing and Community Development
March 2024
ATTACHMENT N 1
[ ] – County Loan Agreement 17
cleanup or detoxification of the Project and the preparation and implementation of any
closure, remedial or other required plans; and (c) all reasonable costs and expenses
incurred by the County or County in connection with clauses (a) and (b), including but
not limited to reasonable attorneys' fees.
7.7 Transfers. During the Term, Borrower shall not sell or otherwise transfer
the Project or any portion thereof, and none of the constituent general partners of
Borrower shall sell or otherwise transfer their interests in Borrower, and none of the
constituent general partners in a partnership that is a partner in Borrower shall sell or
otherwise transfer their interest in such partnership without first obtaining the approval of
the County, which consent the County may withhold or grant in the exercise of its good
faith discretion. The County shall not approve any such transfer request if the Borrower
is in default under any of the Loan Documents or the Management Plan.
7.8 Management; Annual Marketing and Management Plans. Any
management company of the Project and the management agreement with such
management company shall be subject to the prior written approval of the County. The
management agreement shall not be amended, modified, supplemented, terminated or
canceled without the prior written consent of the County. Borrower and the County (if it
so elects) will cooperate in the marketing of the units on the Property pursuant to a
marketing plan (the “Marketing Plan”) prepared by the Borrower and approved by the
County. Said Marketing Plan and the Management Plan described in Section 4.1 hereof
shall be prepared by the Borrower and approved by the County on an annual basis;
however, the Borrower shall provide quarterly written supplements to said approved
plans (or more frequently if requested by the County).
7.9 Operation and Maintenance of Project.
(a) Operation. During the Qualified Project Period, Borrower shall at all
times operate on the Project an affordable housing rental facility in compliance with this
Agreement and the Regulatory Agreement.
(b) Maintenance. During the Qualified Project Period, Borrower agrees to
maintain all interior and exterior improvements, including landscaping (and all abutting
ground, sidewalks, roads, parking and landscape areas) on the Project in good condition,
repair and sanitary condition (and, as to landscaping, in a healthy condition) and in
accordance with any Management Plan approved by the County under the Loan
Agreement (including without limitation any landscape and signage plans), as the same
may be amended from time to time, and all other applicable laws, rules, ordinances,
orders, and regulations of all federal, state, county, municipal, and other governmental
agencies and bodies having jurisdiction and all their respective departments, bureaus, and
officials. Borrower acknowledges the great emphasis the County places on quality
maintenance to protect its investment and to provide quality low-income housing for its
constituents and to ensure that all County-subsidized affordable housing projects within
the County are not allowed to deteriorate due to deficient maintenance. In addition,
Borrower shall keep the Project free from all graffiti and any accumulation of debris or2023 Supportive Housing NOFA Amendment
OC Housing and Community Development
March 2024
ATTACHMENT N 1
[ ] – County Loan Agreement 18
waste material. Borrower shall promptly make all repairs and replacements necessary to
keep the Project in good condition and repair and shall promptly eliminate all graffiti and
replace dead and diseased plants and landscaping with comparable approved materials.
Borrower shall not commit or permit any waste or deterioration of the Project, shall not
abandon any portion of the Project, and shall not otherwise act, or fail to act, in such a
way as to unreasonably increase the risk of damage to the Project.
In the event that Borrower breaches any of the covenants contained in this Section
9.9 and such default continues for a period of five (5) days after written notice from
County (with respect to graffiti, debris, waste material, and general maintenance) or thirty
(30) days after written notice from County (with respect to landscaping and building
improvements), then County, in addition to whatever other remedies it may have under
this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or at law or in equity, shall have the right to
enter upon the Project and perform or cause to be performed all such acts and work
necessary to cure the default. Pursuant to such right of entry, the County shall be permit-
ted (but not required) to enter upon the Project and perform all acts and work necessary to
protect, maintain and preserve the improvements and landscaped areas on the Project, in
the amount of the expenditure arising from such acts and work of protection,
maintenance, and preservation by County and/or reasonable costs of such cure, including
a fifteen percent (15%) administrative charge, which amount shall be promptly paid by
Borrower to County upon demand.
(c) Removal of Personal Property. During the Qualified Project Period,
Borrower shall not cause or permit the removal from the Project of any items of
Borrower’s personal property (other than tools and equipment used in the operation of the
Project) unless (i) no Event of Default remains uncured and (ii) Borrower promptly
substitutes and installs on the Project other items of equal or greater value in the
operation of the Project, all of which shall be free of liens and shall be subject to the liens
of the Deed of Trust and the Financing Statement and executes and delivers to County all
documents required by County in connection with the attachment of such liens to such
items. Borrower shall keep detailed records of such removal and shall make such records
available to County upon written request from time to time.
7.10 Status of Borrower. Borrower shall at all times maintain its legal status
and all material licenses, rights, franchises and privileges in the jurisdiction of its
formation in good standing and comply with all laws, rules and regulations of California
and the United States and of any political subdivision thereof applicable to it or its
business.
7.11 Insurance. While any obligation of Borrower under any Loan Document
remains outstanding, Borrower shall maintain at Borrower's sole expense, the following
policies of insurance in form and substance as follows:
(a) Commercial General Liability insurance in an amount not less than
$1,000,000 per occurrence and $2,000,000 in the aggregate;2023 Supportive Housing NOFA Amendment
OC Housing and Community Development
March 2024
ATTACHMENT N 1
[ ] – County Loan Agreement 19
(b) Commercial Auto Liability insurance covering all owned, non-owned and
hired autos with a limit of $1,000,000 per occurrence);
(c) Statutory Workers' compensation insurance and Employer’s Liability with
a minimum limit of $1,000,000 per occurrence (amounts subject to change to ensure
proper coverage);
(d) Commercial Property Insurance on an “All Risk” or “Special Causes of
Loss” form for 100% of the Replacement Cost Value and no coinsurance provision.
(including insurance against loss by flood if the Project is located in an area now or
hereafter designated as subject to the danger of flood, but excluding insurance against
loss by earthquake);
(e) Rent loss insurance for a period of at least one year;
(f) The Commercial Property policy, shall include a "lender's loss payable
endorsement" to the County assuring County that all proceeds shall be paid to County as
provided in the Deed of Trust subject to the interests of the senior lenders on the Project.
The County shall be an additional named insured on the Commercial General Liability
policy, and such insurance shall be primary and any insurance maintained by the County
shall be excess and non-contributing. All policies shall waive all rights of subrogation
against the County, its elected and appointed officials, officers, agents, and employees.
The general liability policy shall contain a severability of interests clause. Certificates of
insurance and endorsements for all of the above policies (and/or original policies, if
required by the County from time to time), showing the same to be in full force and
effect, shall be delivered to the County;
(g) All self-insured retentions (SIRs) shall be clearly stated on the Certificate
of Insurance. Any self-insured retention (SIR) in an amount in excess of Fifty Thousand
Dollars ($50,000) shall specifically be approved by the County’s Risk Manager, or
designee, upon review of Borrower’s current audited financial report. If Borrower’s SIR
is approved, Borrower, in addition to, and without limitation of, any other indemnity
provision(s) in this Contract, agrees to all of the following:
1. In addition to the duty to indemnify and hold the County harmless
against any and all liability, claim, demand or suit resulting from
Borrower, its agents, employee’s or subcontractor’s performance of
this Contract, Borrower shall defend the County at its sole cost and
expense with counsel approved by Board of Supervisors against
same; and
2. Borrower’s duty to defend, as stated above, shall be absolute and
irrespective of any duty to indemnify or hold harmless; and
3. The provisions of California Civil Code Section 2860 shall apply to
any and all actions to which the duty to defend stated above applies,2023 Supportive Housing NOFA Amendment
OC Housing and Community Development
March 2024
ATTACHMENT N 1
[ ] – County Loan Agreement 20
and the Borrower’s SIR provision shall be interpreted as though the
Borrower was an insurer and the County was the insured.
Upon notice of any actual or alleged claim or loss arising out of
subcontractor’s work hereunder, subcontractor shall immediately satisfy in full the SIR
provisions of the policy in order to trigger coverage for the Borrower and Additional
Insureds.
If the Borrower fails to maintain insurance acceptable to the County for
the full term of this Contract, the County may terminate this Contract.
n.
7.12 Alterations and Repair. Except with the prior consent of the County,
during the Qualified Project Period, Borrower shall not remove, demolish or materially
alter any improvement constituting the Project, except to make non-structural repairs
which preserve or increase the Project’s value, and shall promptly restore, in good and
workmanlike manner, any said improvement (or other aspect of the Project) that is
damaged or destroyed from any cause.
7.13 Changes in Property Restrictions. Borrower shall not initiate, join in or
consent to any change in any applicable zoning ordinance, general plan or similar law, or
to any private restrictive covenant or any similar public or private restriction on the use of
the Project, except with the prior written consent of the County.
7.14 Books, Records and Annual Statement. Borrower shall maintain complete
books of account and other records reflecting the construction and operation of the
Project in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a
consistent basis. During the Qualified Project Period, the amount of the Residual
Receipts (as defined in the Note) shall be determined on the basis of an annual audited
financial statement (”Annual Statement”), for the preceding year, beginning with the first
year of operation of all or any part of the Project, prepared at the Borrower’s expense by
an independent certified public account firm acceptable to the County. Such Annual
Statement shall be prepared based on the guidelines, and taking into account the
information, set forth on Exhibit “C,” attached hereto and incorporated herein. During
the Qualified Project Period, the Borrower shall submit the Annual Statement and any
payment to the County not later than six (6) months after closing of the Borrower’s
previous year’s books. The first Annual Statement submitted by the Borrower for the
Loan shall include the period from the Completion of Construction to the close of that
year’s books. The County shall review and approve such statement, or request revisions,
within ninety (90) days after receipt. In the event that as the result of County review,
there is an increase in the amount of Residual Receipts, Borrower shall pay to the County
the full amount of such increase within ten (10) days of notice of such increases. The
terms of this subsection shall not be the exclusive method by which the County may
review Residual Receipts payments by the Borrower. In the event that an increase in the
amount of Residual Receipts for any annual period is discovered at any time subsequent
to the ninety (90) day period for that year’s books, no previous action or inaction by the2023 Supportive Housing NOFA Amendment
OC Housing and Community Development
March 2024
ATTACHMENT N 1
[ ] – County Loan Agreement 21
County shall prohibit the County from requesting repayment of those amounts at any
time during the term of this Agreement or thereafter. The Borrower shall pay to the
County the full amount of such increase within thirty (30) days of notice of such increase
for periods prior to the previous year.
7.15 Notices of Certain Matters. Borrower shall give notice to County, within
ten (10) days after Borrower receives actual knowledge thereof, of each of the following:
(a) Any litigation or claim against the Borrower relating to the Property or the
Project and involving an amount in excess of $25,000 and any litigation or claim that
might subject Borrower or any constituent partner of Borrower to liability in excess of
$50,000, whether covered by insurance or not;
(b) Any dispute between Borrower and any governmental or public agency
relating to the Property or the Project, the adverse determination of which might
materially affect the Project;
(c) Any trade name hereafter used by Borrower and any change in Borrower’s
principal place of business;
(d) Any Event of Default or event, which, with the giving of notice or the
passage of time, without ameliorative action, or both, would constitute an Event of
Default;
(e) Any default by Borrower or any other party under any Loan Document or
Mortgage Document, or the receipt by Borrower of any notice of default under any Loan
Document or Mortgage Document;
(f) The creation or imposition of any mechanics’ lien or other lien against the
Project;
(g) The presence of any hazardous materials on, under or about the Property
or the Project; any enforcement, clean-up, removal or other action or requirement of any
local, state or federal governmental or quasi-governmental authority with jurisdiction
relating to any such hazardous materials; and the existence of any occurrence of
conditions on any property in the vicinity of the Project that could cause any portion of
the Project to be classified as “border-zone property” under the provisions of the
California Health and Safety Code or any related regulations, or that could cause the
Project to be otherwise subject to any restrictions relating to hazardous materials; and
(h) Any material adverse change in the financial condition of Borrower or any
of its constituent general partners.
7.16 Further Assurances. Borrower shall execute and acknowledge (or cause to
be executed and acknowledged) and deliver to County all documents, and take all
actions, reasonably required by County from time to time to confirm the rights created or2023 Supportive Housing NOFA Amendment
OC Housing and Community Development
March 2024
ATTACHMENT N 1
[ ] – County Loan Agreement 22
now or hereafter intended to be created under the Loan Documents, to protect and further
the validity, priority and enforceability of the Loan Documents, to subject to the Loan
Documents any property intended by the terms of any Loan Document to be covered by
the Loan Documents, or otherwise to carry out the purpose of the Loan Documents and
the transactions contemplated thereunder.
7.17 Liens. Borrower shall not cause or suffer to become effective any lien,
restriction or other title limitation affecting any part of the Project other than the (i)
Regulatory Agreement, the Deed of Trust, the Financing Statement and the liens of the
Permitted Financing and (ii) taxes not delinquent.
7.18 Payment of Expenses. Borrower shall pay the County's costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the making, disbursement and administration of the
Loan, as well as any revisions, transfers, extensions, renewals, modifications, refinancing
or "workouts," and providing estoppels or subordinations of the Loan, and in the exercise
of any of County's rights or remedies under this Agreement. The County will receive
from Borrower a nonrefundable fee in the amount of Five Hundred Dollars ($500) and
Borrower shall reimburse County for all of the County’s reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) incurred in the administration and review
of such changes, to the extent such expenses exceed Five Hundred Dollars ($500). Such
costs and expenses may include title insurance, recording and escrow charges, survey
charges, hazard insurance, premiums, fees for any appraisals and any appraisal reviews,
architectural and engineering review, construction services and environmental and toxic
services and reviews, zoning and entitlement services and reviews, mortgage taxes, legal
fees and any other reasonable fees and costs for services, regardless of whether such
services are furnished by the County's employees or agents or independent contractors.
7.19 Loan Monitoring Fees. Unless prohibited by Federal, State or local laws,
the Borrower shall pay an annual loan monitoring fee during the Term. Loan monitoring
fees shall be incorporated into the operating pro forma. The loan monitoring fee shall
include a one time payment (“One Time Payment”) of Five Hundred Dollars ($500) to
be used for project set-up plus an annual fee (“Annual Fee”) of [AMOUNT] ($XXX),
which will be used to offset the reasonable costs associated with loan monitoring. The
initial One Time Payment fee and initial Annual Fee will be payable to the County at the
Close of Escrow. The Annual Fee will be due each subsequent year for the Qualified
Project Period on or within thirty (30) days of the day and month that this Agreement was
entered into as set forth on page one hereof. Loan monitoring fees will be adjusted
annually. The annual adjustment shall be in accordance with the change in the Consumer
Price Index for Los Angeles –Anaheim - Riverside (All Urban Consumers – All Items)
promulgated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor. This
adjustment shall be calculated by means of the following formula:
A = B x C
D2023 Supportive Housing NOFA Amendment
OC Housing and Community Development
March 2024
ATTACHMENT N 1
[ ] – County Loan Agreement 23
Where: A = Adjusted Annual Fee
B = Annual Fee (as such Annual Fee may have been previously adjusted)
C = Average monthly index for the most recent twelve-month period
D = Average monthly index for the twelve-month period preceding the date of
this Loan Agreement.
In the event that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) ceases to use 1982-84 = 100 as the basis
of calculation, or if, in County’s sole judgment, a substantial change is made in the
method used by the federal government to determine the CPI or the items used to
calculate the CPI, then the CPI shall be converted to the figure that would have been
calculated at (or as close to such figures as shall be practical) had the manner of
calculating the CPI in effect at the date of this Loan Agreement not been altered.
In the event that the CPI is not issued or published for the period for which such
minimum Annual Fees are to be adjusted and computed hereunder, or in the even that the
Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor should cease to
publish said index figures, then any similar index published by any other branch or
department of the United States Government selected by County, shall be used and if
none is so published, then another index general recognized as authoritative shall be
substituted by County.
In the event that the Borrower is required to pay a monitoring fee or One-Time Payment
pursuant to this section any amounts paid towards the monitoring fee or One Time
Payment for the HOME/OTHER COUNTY Loan to the Borrower shall be credited to
the amount due under this section, such that the maximum monitoring fee and One-Time
Payment hereunder combined with the monitoring fee and One-Time Payment for the
HOME Loan shall not exceed $1215, as adjusted in accordance with this section.
[Omitted if HOME/OTHER COUNTY funding is not an additional award.]
7.20 Subcontracts.
(a) Upon request of County, or their designated agent, Borrower shall submit
any requested Subcontract agreements to the County for review and consent. Any
requested Subcontracts shall be submitted to County within forty-eight (48) hours of such
request.
(b) Borrower shall assume responsibility for all subcontracted services to
assure compliance with this Agreement.2023 Supportive Housing NOFA Amendment

Project:

applicable laws, regulations, and rules of governmental agencies having jurisdiction,

implementing regulations (24 C.F.R. § 92, et seq.), and the legal requirements
summarized or referenced in Exhibit No. D attached hereto and incorporated herein by

“I certify that (company name) is in full
compliance with all applicable federal and state reporting requirements for its employees
and with all lawfully served Wage and Earnings Assignment Orders and Notices of
Assignment and will continue to be in compliance throughout the Term of this Agreement
with the County of Orange. I understand that failure to comply shall constitute a

under the Loan Documents or Mortgage Loan Documents that would provide for the
acceleration of the Loan or Mortgage Loan, then County may, after delivery of notice to
Borrower and the expiration of any applicable cure periods, apply the funds in the
Operating Reserve Account to the Loan, a Mortgage Loan, or use such funds for the
continued operation of the Project.2023 Supportive Housing NOFA Amendment

of each year, Borrower shall deposit into the Replacement Reserve Account an amount
equal to three hundred dollars ($XXX) per unit or such higher amount as may be required
by a tax creditor investor or senior Mortgagee and approved by County, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Funds shall be invested subject to the prior
written approval of the County and any earnings shall become and remain a part of the
Replacement Reserve. The Borrowers shall not draw funds from the Replacement
Reserve Account without the prior written approval of the County, which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld.

with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), and have been or will be
depreciated on the Partnership Tax Return, Form 1040P, filed with the Internal Revenue
Service by the Borrower’s accountant.
In the event of a failure by the Borrower to adequately maintain the Project, or
pay operating expenses, mandatory debt service payments, or other payments required
under the Loan Documents or Mortgage Loan Documents, or during the continuance of
an event of default by Borrower under the Loan Documents or Mortgage Loan
Documents that would provide for the acceleration of the Loan or Mortgage Loan, then
County may, after delivery of notice to Borrower and the expiration of any applicable
cure periods, apply the funds in the Replacement Reserve Account to the Loan, a
Mortgage Loan, or use such funds for the maintenance, improvement, or continued

gently cure for thirty (30) days after notice thereof in writing is given by the County to

ATTACHMENT N 1

obligation to make or continue the Loan and shall give the County the right to proceed
with any and all remedies set forth in this Agreement and the Loan Documents or
otherwise available at law or in equity or by statute (and all of the County's rights and
remedies shall be cumulative), including but not limited to the following:
(a) Acceleration of Note. The County shall have the right to cause all
indebtedness of the Borrower to the County under this Agreement and the Note, together
with any accrued interest thereon, to become immediately due and payable. The
Borrower waives all right to presentment, demand, protest or notice of protest, or
dishonor. The County may proceed to enforce payment of the indebtedness and to
exercise any or all rights afforded to the County as a creditor and secured party under the
law including the Uniform Commercial Code, including foreclosure under the Deed of
Trust. The Borrower shall be liable to pay the County on demand all expenses, costs and
fees (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and expenses) paid or incurred by the
County in connection with the collection of the Loan and the preservation, maintenance,
protection, sale, or other disposition of the security given for the Loan.
(b) Specific Performance. The County shall have the right to mandamus or
other suit, action or proceeding at law or in equity to require Borrower to perform its
obligations and covenants under the Loan Documents or to enjoin acts on things that may
be unlawful or in violation of the provisions of the Loan Documents.
(c) Right to Cure at Borrower's Expense. The County shall have the right to
cure any monetary default by Borrower under a loan other than the Loan. The Borrower
agrees to reimburse the County for any funds advanced by the County to cure a monetary
default by Borrower upon demand therefore, together with interest thereon at the rate of
twelve percent (12%) per annum (which rate shall in no event exceed the maximum rate
permitted by law and if it does, said rate shall be reduced to the maximum rate then
permitted by law), from the date of expenditure until the date of reimbursement.
8.3 Remedies Cumulative. No right, power, or remedy given to the County by
the terms of this Agreement or the Loan Documents is intended to be exclusive of any
other right, power, or remedy; and each and every such right, power, or remedy shall be
cumulative and in addition to every other right, power, or remedy given to the County by
the terms of any such instrument, or by any statute or otherwise against Borrower and any
other person. Neither the failure nor any delay on the part of the County to exercise any
such rights and remedies shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise by the County of any such right or remedy preclude any other or further exercise
of such right or remedy, or any other right or remedy.
8.4 Waiver of Terms and Conditions. No waiver of any default or breach by
Borrower hereunder shall be implied from any omission by the County to take action on
account of such default if such default persists or is repeated, and no express waiver shall
affect any default other than the default specified in the waiver, and such waiver shall be
operative only for the time and to the extent therein stated. Waivers of any covenant,
term, or condition contained herein shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent2023 Supportive Housing NOFA Amendment
OC Housing and Community Development
March 2024
ATTACHMENT N 1
[ ] – County Loan Agreement 31
breach of the same covenant, term, or condition. The consent or approval by the County
to or of any act by Borrower requiring further consent or approval shall not be deemed to
waive or render unnecessary the consent or approval to or of any subsequent similar act.
The exercise of any right, power, or remedy shall in no event constitute a cure or a waiver
of any default under this Agreement or the Loan Documents, nor shall it invalidate any
act done pursuant to notice of default, or prejudice the County in the exercise of any
right, power, or remedy hereunder or under the Loan Documents, unless in the exercise
of any such right, power, or remedy all obligations of Borrower to County are paid and
discharged in full.

documents to fulfill the purposes of this Agreement.
3. BOARD’S RIGHT OF ACCESS: The Board shall have the right of ingress and egress in, through,

alteration, repair or replacement shall be at the Grantor’s expense.

and occupancy of the Easement insofar as such use and occupancy is consistent with and does not impair

Anupma Thakur & others Vs. Smt. Bijaya Mishra & others
- 7 -
Original (Partition) Suit No. 28 of 2007
fact that Choudhary Baidya Nath Thakur was the common ancestor of the
parties and has his ancestral properties within the District of Darbhanga at
village Singhwara out of the earning of his ancestral properties purchased
the suit property out of the earning from his ancestral properties in the
name of his wife Smt. Anand Kishori Devi Except the properties situated at
village Singhwara, the said Baidya Nath Thakur had no other properties
except the suit property situated within Deoghar Municipality purchased by
the above named late Baidyanath Thakur in the year 1959 Unfortunately
the said Choudhary Baidya Nath Thakur died a premature death on account
of Cancer leaving behind his widow two daughters and four sons and out of
them the three of his issues namely Mithilesh Thakur, Bibha Mishra and
Choudhary Sanjay Thakur were minors and all the issues except the eldest
daughters were unmarried and hence the story of family settlement about
forty years back as given in para 3 of the plaint is completely false and
strongly denied by these defendants. The said story of family settlement as
alleged in para 3 of the plaint has been maliciously invented with ulterior
motive. The plaintiff took V.R.S. long before his retirement. It is important
to note here that in the year 1967 when Choudhary Baidya Nath Thakur
died the plaintiff was simply a major about 19 years of age and was
continuing in his education and as such the question of family settlement
and partition of ancestral properties by way of family settlement does not
arise or could be conceived specially when the three issues of Choudhary
Baidya Nath Thakur were minors and Choudhary Nand Kishore Thakur
and Anand Kishore Devi were looking after all of them and the family of
Choudhary Baidya Nath Thakur was joint for all intents and purposes and
even Choudhary Nand Kishore Thakur the eldest son was proceeding in his
education career. All the expenses on all the descendants of Choudhary
Baidya Nath Thakur used to be managed by the mother Anand Kishori
Debi. The story of family settlement was concocted on account of the illegal
unauthorized sale deeds executed by the plaintiff and his son without any
knowledge to these defendants and others. The story of abiding by the
imaginary fictitious family settlement and partition are all false, invented
and concocted ones, only to harass and blackmail these defendants by
Anupma Thakur & others Vs. Smt. Bijaya Mishra & others
- 8 -
Original (Partition) Suit No. 28 of 2007
reckless unauthorized illegal sale deeds executed by the plaintiff and his son
(Abhisek Thakur) with respect to joint family ancestral properties of village
Singhwara Singhwa. That so far the statements contained in para 4 of the
plaint are concerned the same are partly correct and partly incorrect and
hence strongly denied by these defendants. The suit property was not
purchased by Smt. Anand Kishori Devi rather the same was purchased by
Choudhary Baidya Nath Thakur long before his death in the month of
December 1959 (26.12.1959) from Pratap Kumar Ghosh s/o late Radha
Raman Ghose out of the earnings of the ancestral properties situated at
village Singhwara P.S., Subdivision Sub-regestry and District Darbhanga,
and the suit property also a part and parcel of the ancestral properties held
by Choudhary Baidya Nath Thakur who was admittedly a substantials man
having vast ancestral properties at village Singhwara. The suit property
through Deed No. 2360 for the year 1959 was purchased by Choudhary
Baidyanath Thakur in the name of his wife Anand Kishori Devi @
Ramabati Thakurain out of the incomes accumulated from the earnings of
joint family ancestral properties. That so far the statements contained in
para 5 of the plaint are concerned the same are partly correct and partly
incorrect and misleading ones and hence the same are strongly denied by
these defendants. As a matter of fact that it was Choudhary Baidya Nath
Thakur who purchased the suit property out of the earnings of the ancestral
joint family properties situated at village Singhwara in the name of Smt.
Anand Kishori Devi and it is Baidya Nath Thakur who got the name
mutated of his wife in Anchal office and in Deoghar Municipality. It is,
absolutely false to say that it is Anand Kishori Thakur who constructed the
Ist floor of the suit properties rather the same was constructed by late
Choudhary Nand Kishore Thakur out of his own earning long after the
purchase of the suit property and after the death of Choudhary Baidya Nath
Thakur, Smt. Anand Kishori Thakur had no income of her own rather she
was a house wife and since after the premature death of Baidya Nath
Thakur remained all along dependent on the income of her eldest son
Choudhary Nand Kishore Thakur after Choudhary Nand Kishore Thakur
finished his education It is important to note that since after the serious
Anupma Thakur & others Vs. Smt. Bijaya Mishra & others
- 9 -
Original (Partition) Suit No. 28 of 2007
illness of Choudhary Baidya Nath Thakur spent all the huge amount in the
treatment of Choudhary Baidya Nath Thakur on his death incurred the
expenses of his shradh out of his own personal income. That so far the
statements contained in para 6 of the plaint are concerned the same are
substantially correct and hence admitted by these defendants. That so far
the statements contained in para 7 of the plaint are concerned the same are
absolutely incorrect, misleading and hence strongly denied by these
defendants as it was Choudhary Nand Kishore Thakur who all along
maintained his mother Deoghar out of his own earning living in the suit
house and properties. The plaintiff since after joining of his service remained
all along at different places of his service and lastly after opting for V.R.S.
has established at Gaziabad after purchasing suitable accommodation for
him and his family member and all of them have been living at Gaziabad
permanently since the year 2000 A.D. after his retirement on V.R.S. The
husband of the defendant no 1 namely Dr. Jagdish Mishra was Lecturer in
Bhagalpur Engineering College and after retirement has Darbhanga at
Darbhanga after constructing his residential house at Darbhanga. The
defendant no. 7 Mithilesh Thakur has also been in service at New Delhi and
the plaintiff and defendant no. 7 are incomplete collusion. The present suit
was filed by the plaintiff in complete connivance with the defendant no. 7
Choudhary Mithilesh Thakur. The defendant no. 8 has been residing at
Patna after purchasing apartment at Patna after his retirement from
Mithila University. It is only defendant no.9 who has been living at village
Singhwara @ Singhwa and looking after all the ancestral properties
situated ancestral village Singhwa in the District of Darbhanga. Thus it is
absolutely false to say that all the parties have been jointly possessing the
suit house and properties. As a matter of fact Choudhary Nand Kishore
Thakur all along lived in the suit house and has been in possession of the
entire suit properties since after commencement of service at, mother and out
of his Deoghar with his widow mother and out of his own income after
demolishing the old dilapidated house on the suit premises constructed
double storied building on the same out of his own earning without taking
any help from any where. It is further important to note that the late Nand
Anupma Thakur & others Vs. Smt. Bijaya Mishra & others
- 10 -
Original (Partition) Suit No. 28 of 2007
Kishore Thakur spent the entire amount incurred in the Shradh ceremony of
his parents and the venue of Shradh ceremony was at Deoghar. It is,
absolutely false to say that Smt. Anand Kishori Devi constructed any portion
of the suit house and came in possession jointly with all her children as since
after finishing of education it was Choudhary Nand Kishore Thakur who
managed the suit property include the same and maintained the mother out
of his own personal earning. That so for the allegation contained in para-8
of the plaint are concerned the same are substantially correct and admitted
by these defendants. That so far the statements contained in para-9 of the
plaint are concerned the same are partly correct and partly incorrect and
hence strongly denied by these defendants. It is a fact that the plaintiff was
in service in Bank of Baroda but has settled himself along with his family
members at Ghaziabad. The plaintiff has got absolutely no intention nor any
necessity to live at Deoghar rather the plaintiff is out to sell his interest in
the suit properties after getting his 1/6th share in partition but the plaintiff
has got mala fide motive in not including all the ancestral lands and
properties in the present suit for partition and hence the present suit is
absolutely not maintainable in view of seeking partial partition. The
plaintiff with ulterior mala fide motive has filed the present suit for alleged
partition of his share in Deoghar property alone without including the
ancestral properties situated at village Singhwa @ Singhwara within the
District of Darbhanga. The plaintiff must include all the ancestral property
left by Choudhary Baidya Nath Thakur in the present suit situated at
village Singhwara within the district of Darbhanga. That so far the
statements contained in para-10 of the plaint are concerned the same are
substantially correct and admitted by these defendants. That so far the
statements contained in para-11 of the plaint are concerned the same are
absolutely false and strongly denied by these defendants. The plaintiff
voluntarily retired from his service about 8 years ago and permanently
settled at Gaziabad after purchasing apartment at Gaziabad during the life
time of Choudhary Nand Kishore Thakur and hence the alleged will to
settle at Deoghar could have been materialized soon after his retirement
during the life time of Choudhary Nand Kishore Thakur. The plaintiff after
Anupma Thakur & others Vs. Smt. Bijaya Mishra & others
- 11 -
Original (Partition) Suit No. 28 of 2007
the death of his eldest brother Choudhary Nand Kishore Thakur attempted
to sell way his 1/6th.share in the suit property by forcible partition of the
suit property alone without including the ancestral properties situated at
village Singhwara in the District of Darbhanga only to harass and blackmail
these defendants who have been in exclusive occupation of the same after
incurring huge cost in constructing the same out of the income of late
Choudhary Nandkishore Thakur. The forcible dishonest mala fide entry and
disturbance of these defendants was strongly protested by these defendant
and as a result of which the plaintiff filed the present suit for partition of
Deoghar property aims alone with mala fide ulterior motive. The forcible
illegal dishonest and mala fide game of forcible occupation of the suit house
was strongly protested by these defendants if the plaintiff wants any share
in the ancestral properties left by his father all the ancestral properties must
be brought to hoch-poch for partition and unless all the ancestral properties
are included in the present suit, the suit cannot proceed on account of defect
seeking partial partition. That so far the allegations given in para 12 of the
plaint are concerned the same are absolutely false and hence strongly denied
by these defendant. The question of seeking partial partition with malafide
ulterior motive cannot be conceivable both on grounds of law and facts. That
the allegations given in para 13, 14 and 15 of the plaint are also
misconceived, imaginary and fictitious one as though the suit property
situated in Deoghar town, the present suit is not maintainable unless all the
ancestral properties left by Choudhary Baidya Nath Thakur are included as
subject matter for partition. The plaintiff has got absolutely no legal and
valid cause of action for seeking partial partition as alleged in para 14 and
the same is both illegal and absolutely not conceivable both on grounds of
law and facts. The present suit in the present form is absolutely not
maintainable. That so far the allegation given in para 16 of the plaint are
concerned, the same are partly correct and partly incorrect and hence
strongly denied by these defendants. It is a fact that plaintiff has got 1/6th
legal share in the whole ancestral properties but the plaintiff has got not
legal valid right to choose one and leave other properties for partition. It is
absolutely false to say that the defendant 2nd party members are out to sell
Anupma Thakur & others Vs. Smt. Bijaya Mishra & others
- 12 -
Original (Partition) Suit No. 28 of 2007
the suit properties. It was Choudhary Nand Kishore Thakur who constructed
all the houses on the suit properties out of his own earning and these
defendants have got absolutely no other place residence than the present one
and hence the allegation of sale of suit house and premises are all
fictitious ,imaginary, false and concocted one only to harass and blackmail
these defendants who are victims of the untimely death of Choudhary Nand
Kishore Thakur who was the bread earner of the family and these defendant
have got sentimental attachment with the suit houses and premises where
except defendant No. 2 were borne and brought up since after their birth.
That the suit has been improperly valued. That the suit is barred under law.
That the suit is defective on account of non-inclusion of all the ancestral
properties. That the suit is otherwise bad and absolutely not maintainable
both on grounds of law and facts. That the plaintiff is not entitled to any
relief or reliefs as claimed in the plaint and the present suit is liable to be
dismissed with cost.
Written Statement on behalf of the defendant No 4 namely Pranav Thakur,
4. That the defendant no. 4 has been in service and resides at New Delhi
having its address B-58 Tahsil Road, Shai Baba Enclave, Nazargarh, New
Delhi and attend his office situated at Gugoan and for the last about more
than 2 years this defendant could not come to Deoghar and see his mother
and other family members. The above named defendant has joined his
service more than 3 years ago while the father of this defendant was alive.
This defendant since after joining his service seldom resides at Deoghar and
on account of the tragic death of his father has been perplexed and never
come to Deoghar for the last about 2 years on account of the tragic past
memory of the father while living at Deoghar. The above named defendant
has absolutely no knowledge of the present suit filed by the plaintiff
Choudhary Murlidhar Thakur nor my mother or younger brother ever
informed me or sent any intimation regarding the filing of the present suit
by Choudhary Murlidhar Thakur with the sole purpose to keep me in peace
without giving mental torture arising out of the present suit. That even the
plaintiff Choudhary Murlidhar Thakur or his son Abhishek Thakur who live
at Gaziyabad ever asked me regarding any partition of Deoghar property nor
Anupma Thakur & others Vs. Smt. Bijaya Mishra & others
- 13 -
Original (Partition) Suit No. 28 of 2007
ever informed this defendant regarding filing of the present suit against my
widowed mother and others for partitioning the suit property situated at
Deoghar only, The above named defendant could know about the present suit
on the 24th of August 2008 after my arrival at Deoghar. This defendant was
neither served with any notice regarding the filing of the present suit nor
the same was ever published in News paper published at either New Delhi or
Gurgoan. This defendant after arrival at Deoghar had the opportunity to see
the plaint of the plaintiff Choudhary Murlidhar Thakur and surprised to see
my residential address at Flat No. 107, Type III, North west Motibag, New
Delhi. Rather this address as shown in the plaint is absolutely incorrect and
misleading one as Choudhary Mithilesh Thakur the third younger brother
of the father of this defendant actually resides at said Flat No. 107 New
Delhi. Thus under the above circumstances in absence of any knowledge or
service of notice of the present suit or in the present suit through the process
of the court and hence the above named defendant no. 4 was prevented from
filing the W.S. on his behalf in the present suit which caused dely in filing
the present W.S. on his behalf. save and except what is expressly admitted
in this written statements denies each and every allegations contained in
the plaint which has been filed by the plaintiff in collusion with defendant
no. 7 namely Choudhary Mithilesh Thakur. That it is important to mention
here that since the deceased father of this defendant namely Choudhary
Nand Kishore Thakur was teaching in Deoghar Collage and all along resided
at the suit house and premises all the defendants and plaintiff including
other family members who have not been in-pleaded in the present suit
arrived at family settlement regarding the suit properties after about 1 year
of the death of the father of this defendant regarding the partition of the suit
properties which was written on non-judicial stamp papers purchased at
Darbhanga by the uncle of this defendant Sanjay Kumar Thakur which
remained unsigned on account of evasive attitude resorted to by and on
behalf of the plaintiff. It is further important to note that in or about the
month of August 2006 the defendant no. 7 took a total sum of Rs.
1,00,000/- (one lakh) for transferring the share and interst of the
defendant no. 7 in the suit properties in favour of the mother of this
Anupma Thakur & others Vs. Smt. Bijaya Mishra & others
- 14 -
Original (Partition) Suit No. 28 of 2007
defendant which was paid through Bank Draft to the extent of 85,000/- and
15,000/- in cash. The present suit was filed by Choudhary Murlidhar
Thakur in the month of March 2007 perhaps being aggrieved with mother of
this defendant who was asked to give Rs. 3,00,000/- (three lakhs) for
transferring the share and interest of the plaintiff in the suit properties and
which flatly was refused by the mother of this defendant and the defendant
no. 7 was to devour the amount of Rs. 1,00,000/- given to the defendant no.
7 by this defendant on the order of the mother of this defendant. That the
defendant has got absolutely no clash of interest with the defendants nos. 2,
3, 5 and 6 as they are mother and younger brother and sisters of this
defendant and as such this defendant nos. 2, 3, 5 and 6 on 13.06.2008 and
the said W.S. may kindly be accepted as the W.S. of this defendant as well.
That the plaintiff suit is absolutely not maintainable in the eye of law as the
plaintiff has not included all the ancestral properties in the present suit and
the present suit also suffers from non-joinder of necessary parties and hence
the present suit is in the form absolutely not maintainable under law both on
grounds of seeking partial partition and for non-joinder of necessary parties
in the present suit. That this defendant was further surprised to know about
the illegal unauthorized sale of ancestral properties by the plaintiff situated
in the ancestral place of the parties of the present suit by executing illegal
unauthorized dishonest sale deed for wrongful illegal gain with dishonest
sinister malafide ulterior motive. That the plaintiff had absolutely no valid
cause of action for the present suit in the present form isolating the other
ancestral joint family properties situated in the District of Drbhanga and
hence the present suit is liable to be dismissed in entirety. That this
defendant on account of sinister malafide dishonest move of the plaintiff has
been compelled to file the counter claim in the present suit nd the cause of
action for the counter claim arose soon after about 4 months the death of the
father of this defendant who died on 31.08.2005 and in order to avoid
repetition the averments given in the plaint of the counter claim should also
be treated s part and parcel of the defence of this defendant in the present
suit. That under the above premises the plaintiff is not entitled to any relief
as claimed in the plaint and the present suit is liable to be dismissed with

7. I have heard the arguments put forwarded by both sides. I have also
perused the pleadings of both sides along with the entire evidences on record
by both the parties and gave my thoughtful consideration while deciding the
following issues.
DISCUSSION, DECISION AND REASONS FOR SUCH DECISION
ISSUE-WISE FINDING:
8. Issue No. (I) Is the suit maintainable in its present form ? Opp.
G.T. of the plaint shows that Anand Kishori Devi had four sons and
two daughters as mentioned in para 4 of the plaint. Schedule of the plaint
claimed to be their ancestral property and self acquired property inherited
by Anand Kishori Devi. There is no averments of previous partition in the
plaint with respect to this property. That as per above suit is very much
Anupma Thakur & others Vs. Smt. Bijaya Mishra & others
- 17 -
Original (Partition) Suit No. 28 of 2007
maintainable in its present form and plaintiffs have to right to seek
partition. Thus this issue is decided in favour of the plaintiffs.
9. Issue No. (II) Whether plaintiff has valid cause of action for the suit?
Opp.
In the law, a cause of action is a set of facts sufficient to justify a right
to sue to obtain money, property, or the enforcement of a right against
another party. In other words cause of action can be defined as bundle of
facts affirmed by one party and denied by the other. A cause of action in a
civil suit, renders several sets of facts asserted by some body against other,
which gave right to sue and when the parties in a civil suit successfully
proves such facts in their favor that helps the parties to get judicial reliefs
through competent court of jurisdiction. In the instant suit it has been shown
that on 08.03.2007 cause of action has been arisen when the defendants has
refused for amicable partition. There is recurring cause of action in a
partition suit. Thus this issue is decided in favour of the plaintiffs.
10. Issue No. (III) Whether the suit is barred by law of limitation, waiver,
acquiescence or estoppel? Opp.
This issue is ornamental and has not been pressed before me,
therefore, it is disposed of as not pressed.
11. ISSUE No. (VI) Whether the suit is bad for exclusion of other rest
immovable property lies at Darbhanga (Bihar)? Opp.
11.1 Whether the suit for partial partition filed by plaintiff is maintainable
ignoring the fact that the suit does not embrace entire joint family property
especially ignoring the property held by them in Darbhanga (Bihar). There
is no dispute in genealogical tree. The suit property originally belonged to
late Smt. Anand Kishori Devi. Plaintiff Murlidhar Thakur and defendants
namely smt. Bijya Mishra, Choudhary Nand Kishore Thakur, Choudhary
Mithilesh Thakur, Smt. Bibha Mishra, and Choudhary Sanjay Kumar
Thakur are the sons and daughters of Smt. Anand Kishori Devi. Plaintiff
commenced an action seeking decree for partition of his 1/6th share in the
scheduled suit property described in Schedule attached with the plaint
stating inter alia that the scheduled suit property was purchased with the
income of their father late Choudhary Baidyanath Thakur, who was a
Anupma Thakur & others Vs. Smt. Bijaya Mishra & others
- 18 -
Original (Partition) Suit No. 28 of 2007
substantial man. It is further case of the plaintiff that defendant No. 2 to 6
refused to allot share demanded by him in the joint family property, leading
to institution of suit seeking decree of partition and separate possession to
the 1/6th share in the scheduled suit property.
11.2 Defendants No. 7 filed his written statement denying the contentions
of the plaintiff and took a principal defence that suit property should be
partitoned in four equal share as Bijya Mishra and Bibha Mishra have been
married in well off family, therefore no share should be given to them.
Defendant No. 2,3,5, and 6 filed their joint written statement stating inter
alia that suit is liable to be dismissed on the ground of non inclusion of other
properties situated at district Darbhanga ( Bihar ). Defendant no. 4 also filed
his separate WS contended that plaintiff, ignoring the fact that the entire
suit property held by parties in the State of Bihar has not been embraced in
the instant suit. Thus, the suit for partial partition as framed and filed by
plaintiff was not maintainable.
11.3 As against this, Mr. Baidyanath Yadav, learned Senior counsel
appearing for the plaintiff submitted that the plaintiff and defendants have
already partitioned their ancestral property at Darbhanga ( Bihar ) about
40 years ago and there is no other joint family property except the scheduled
suit property described in Schedule attached with plaint ready for partition.
11.4 It is well-settled principle of law that a suit for a division of a portion
of the family property cannot lie as a suit for partial partition is not
maintainable. The suit for partition of family property must embrace all the
joint family property. The root question that falls for consideration before
this Court is whether the defendants' No. 2 to 6 have pleaded and
established that the parties have some more joint family property, which has
not been embraced while filing the instant suit for partition? In order to
have a proper comprehension of the attack made during course of argument
that the suit is for partial partition, a brief and quick survey of plaint is
imperative. A close reading of the entire plaint would show that the plaintiff
has pleaded that the scheduled suit property described in Schedule attached
with the plaint have been purchased by his mother late Smt. Anand Kishori
Devi, who died intestate in the year 1997. She was chiefly a name-lender
Anupma Thakur & others Vs. Smt. Bijaya Mishra & others
- 19 -
Original (Partition) Suit No. 28 of 2007
and the said property was purchaed out of income of his father late
Choudhary Baidyanath Thakur, a substantial man. After the death of late
Smt. Anand Kishori Devi, plaintiff and defendants came in joint possession
of the same. The defendants' No. 2 to 6 while filing their written statement
raised specific objection in the written statement with regard to that other
property being held jointly by them at Darbhanga ( Bihar ) has been left
out in the instant suit, but they did not identify or elaborated that any
property other than the scheduled suit property is rather ready for partition
in the instant suit. Thus, from the perusal of the plaint and written
statements, it would appear that the defendants No. 2 to 6 did not take any
specific plea that property other than the scheduled suit property is ready
and available for partition among the parties to be included in the instant
suit filed by the plaintiff has been left out, except unspecific and vague plea
taken by them.
11.5 Ext. F. is the CC of plaint of Partition Suit no. 49 of 2016 filed before
the Court of Ld. Sub-Judge 1st, Darbhanga. Para 8 of the same reads as
under:-
“ That..... ancestor of the plaintiff had enormous properties as they belong
to Zamindar family. There was a Partition Suit no. 211/1949 for the properties of
the family in which the plaintiff , his elder brothers Choudhary Nand Kishore
Thakur and their father Choudhary Baidyanath Thakur got properties in separate
schedule, in which the plaintiff and his elder brother were then minors and other
brothers of the plaintiff were not born till date.” Para 9 of the same reads as
under “
That separate schedule were carved out for the family members but the
suit is only concerned with the property of the schedule allotted to Choudhary
Baidyanath Thakur and his two minor sons and now only two plot no. of
Singhwara mouza are being subject matter of the suit as other properties of Bihar
are already sold either by one person or the other of the family”.
11.6 Ext.-G is the C/c of petition filed on behalf of the plaintiff of the
plaint of Partition Suit no. 49/2016 before the court of Sub Judge-VIII,
Darbhanga which reads as under para 4 that “
as such taking legal advice and
with a view to avoid multiplicity of the proceeding that …….. plaintiff may be
permitted to withdraw the suit” Ext.-E is the C/c of order sheet of Partition
Suit no. 49/2016 wherein order dated 30.03.2017 states that “
Partition Suit
No. 28/2007 and Partition Suit No. 102/2008 are pending at Deoghar.
Anupma Thakur & others Vs. Smt. Bijaya Mishra & others
- 20 -
Original (Partition) Suit No. 28 of 2007Particularly in Partition Suit No. 102/2008 schedule property of Partition Suit
No. 49/2016 i.e. property at mouza Singhwara is the subject matter. W.S. filed by
defendant no. 11 in Partition Suit No. 49/2016 admits that there is partition of
the schedule property of mouza Singhwara. Under such circumstances a petition
has been filed to withdraw the case. Accordingly, the prayer is allowed and the suit
is dismissed as withdrawn”. Ext.-A to D are different C/c of sale deeds with
respect to mouza Singhwara, Darbhanga, which all shows that either the
plaintiff or his son (substituted plaintiff) were the vendor.
11.7 From perusal of above documents and submissions, it is peculiar to
note that plaintiff took the plea of previous partition as mentioned as
Partition Suit No. 211/1949 when the defendants were not even born. No
specific details of property have been given in the present suit. Neither it is
averred that who were the parties besides Choudhary Baidyanath Thakur in
the Partition Suit No. 211/1949. No such documents with respect to
Partition Suit No. 211/1949 have been adduced in the instant suit. Under
such circumstances, parties failed to adduce evidence giving specific details
of property falling under the share of late Choudhary Baidyanath Thakur,
common ancestor of the parties of this suit. Different sale deeds and
averments made in Partition Suit No. 49/2016 shows that parties have some
properties situated at mouza Singhwara, Darbhanga but failed to establish
that it was their common ancestor property ready and available for partition
which has not been embraced in the present suit.
11.8 Law in respect of partial partition is well settled after the Bench
decision of Rajendra vs. Brajendra, AIR 1923 Cal 501 “that in a suit for
partition all the properties must be brought into the hotch-potch”. But there
are exceptions, i.e., when the properties are situated in different districts,
there is different law for the property which is distantly situated, when the
property is not partible and when the property is not in possession of the
coparceners and may consequently be deemed to be really not available for
partition. This principle has been followed in the bench case Kasiswar vs.
Nakkuleswar in. At all events the plaint indicates that there were properties
in a different state, i.e. in Bihar The suit is not hit by the doctrine of partial
partition.
Anupma Thakur & others Vs. Smt. Bijaya Mishra & others
- 21 -
Original (Partition) Suit No. 28 of 2007
12. Thus, in the light of aforesaid pronouncements of law, it is held that
though the suit for partial partition is not maintainable, but in the instant
case, the defendants' No. 2 to 6 have utterly and miserably failed to establish
that the property jointly held by the parties in the jurisdiction of the Court,
is ready/available for partition and if any property is situated outside the
jurisdiction of the Court, trying the suit would come within the exception as
pointed out in case of Rajendra Kumar Bose (supra) followed in Mahadev
Missir (supra).
Thus this issue is decided accordingly and it is held that the suit is not
bad for partial partition.
13. ISSUE NO. (IV) Whether there is unity of title and community of
interest and possession of properties mentioned in schedule appended to the
plaint ? Opp. AND ISSUE No. (V) Whether there is any previous partition
among the parties? Opp. AND ISSUE No. (VIII) Whether the suit property
is the purchased property of Smt. Anandi Kishori Devi and she was the
absolute owner of the said property ? Opp.
Ext.-1 is the C/c of Sale Deed in favour of Smt. Anand Kishori Devi,
mother of plaintiff and defendant, which is the schedule property of the
present suit. Admittedly the said Anand Kishori Devi purchased a single
storied house attached with 10 kattha of Basouri lands in the year 1958
from late Pratap Kumar Ghosh through a registered sale deed bearing no.
2360 of 1959 duly registered at Deoghar Sub-registry on payment of lawful
consideration and came into peaceful possession of the same along with her
family. Subsequently she mutated her name with revenue authority and
paying the taxes and rent to Govt. exchequer. She died intestate in the year
1997 leaving behind her four sons and two daughters who are the parties of
this suit. Her husband late Choudhary Baidyanath Thakur was predeceased
died in the year 1967. Admittedly she was chiefly a name-lander and the
said schedule property was purchased from the income of her husband.
Accordingly it is held that the schedule property was her self acquired
property from the income of her husband and after her death the schedule
property was put in common stock in joint Hindu family. Admittedly there is
no previous partition with respect to this property. Admittedly there is no
Anupma Thakur & others Vs. Smt. Bijaya Mishra & others
- 22 -
Original (Partition) Suit No. 28 of 2007
other ancestral/immovable property of the parties situated at Deoghar
which has not been included in the plaint. Contesting defendant no. 2 to 6
contended that it is them who are living in the said schedule property and
are in their exclusive possession, maintained by them and emotionally
attached with the schedule property. It can be said that possession of one
sharer deemed to be the possession of other co-sharer in a joint Hindu
family. As above, it can safely be said that parties have unity of title and
community of interest and possession of properties mentioned in schedule
appended to the plaint and there is no previous partition amongst the parties
and available for partition. Thus these issues are decided accordingly.
14. ISSUE No. (VII) Whether the plaintiff is entitled for a preliminary
decree with respect to right, title and interest to get 1/6 share in the suit
properties of the scheduled appended to the plaint? Opp.
As above discussed under the issue no. IV, V & VIII, it is held that
plaintiff is entitled for a preliminary decree with respect to right, title and
interest to get 1/6th share in the suit property. The objection raised by
defendant no. 7 that two daughters namely Bijaya Mishra and Bibha Mishra
who got married in well of family are not required to be allotted any share
has no force. Accordingly, this objection is hereby dismissed. All the sons
and daughters are equally entitled to have their share in ancestral
property. Thus this issue is decided in favour of the plaintiff. In the
result, it is hereby
O R D E R E D
that in conclusion the suit is preliminarily decreed without cost. It is
declared that
1) Schedule of the plaint is joint ancestral property of plaintiff and
defendants.
2) The plaintiff is entitled to right, title and possession of his equitable 1/6th
share in schedule land by metes and bound.
3) The plaintiff is entitled to preliminary decree of partition of equitable
1/6th share in schedule land by metes and bound.
4) It is declared that after partition by competent authority plaintiff is also
entitled to separate possession of his equitable 1/6th share in schedule

property as per law of land.
5) Commission be appointed in due course to effect partition of his equitable
1/6th share in schedule property as per law of land by metes and bound and
to deliver separate possession thereof to the plaintiff and defendants.
6) The plaintiff is also entitled to prohibitory injunction restraining the
defendants from making construction and sale of the joint property till
making of partition and giving of separate possession. The defendants are
also permanently restrained from interfering and obstructing the separate
possession of the plaintiff’s land allotted to him after partition.
Prepare a decree accordingly.
15. This judgment and order is delivered and operative part of this
judgment is pronounced in the open court on this 15th day of July, 2024. Case
is consigned to Record room after due compliance.
