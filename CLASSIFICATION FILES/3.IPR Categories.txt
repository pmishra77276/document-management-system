A BRANCHED PILE FOUNDATION
Applicant: National Institute of Technology Silchar

Nationality- Indian
The following Specification particularly describes and ascertains
the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be25

FIELD OF THE INVENTION:5
[002] The present invention relates to a pile foundation,
particularly the invention relates to a branched pile foundation
having branches oriented to a specific angle in order to increase
the load carrying capacity of a conventional pile.10
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:
[003] In soft to very soft clayey soils, pile foundations are
commonly used to transfer the load from the superstructure to the15
underlying ground. A typical pile foundation transfers the load in
two ways: through friction along the pile's surface and end bearing
at the pile’s toe. However, in very soft clayey soil, the end bearing
part is minimal, and the entire load from the superstructure is
supported by friction along the pile's circumference. This results20
in the need to increase the pile's frictional capacity to ensure a
higher load transfer.
[004] To achieve this, the length of the pile must be
increased. For low-rise buildings, such as those with two stories,
pile lengths of around 15 to 18 meters are often required, which25
significantly raises construction costs. Additionally, constructing
an 18-meter-long pile in very soft clayey soil can be extremely
challenging. Hence some technique with reduced pile length is
required.
[005] Several methods have been proposed to increase the30
capacity of cylindrical piles in soft soils, with two common types
being the belled pile and the root pile. Both of these pile types
offer higher load-carrying capacities compared to conventional
3
piles. However, they present significant construction challenges5
when used in soft to very soft clayey soils. For instance, the bell-
shaped end of a belled pile is prone to collapse under the
overburden pressure, and achieving proper compaction of
concrete in the belled portion is difficult. In India, underreamed
piles are in vogue instead of belled piles. Similar problems occur10
in underreamed pile foundation also. As a result, it is often
reported that the underreams fail to form as intended, leading to
the near discontinuation of this practice in India.
[006] Similarly, root piles face construction difficulties, as
the roots, which are supposed to be perpendicular to the pile shaft,15
are hard to construct accurately in the field. Additionally, there is
a risk of root failure when the load is shared between the roots
and the main shaft of the pile. These challenges contribute to the
limited use of both belled and root piles in soft clayey soils,
highlighting the need for more efficient and practical solutions for20
improving pile performance in such conditions.
[007] Therefore, there exists a need for a pile structure that
reduces the required pile length while maintaining the foundation's
effectiveness in load carrying capacity.
25
OBJECTIVE OF THE INVENTION:
[008] An objective of the present invention is to improve
upon the conventional problems as described above, and to
enhance the frictional resistance of conventional pile foundations30
by incorporating branches into the pile structure, thereby
improving load transfer capacity in soft to very soft clayey soils.
4
[009] Another objective of the invention is to reduce the5
required pile length, minimize construction costs, and overcome
the challenges of installing long piles in such soil conditions while
maintaining the stability and effectiveness of the foundation.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED
EMBODIMENTS:25
[022] Before presenting configuration of a branched pile, it
is to be understood that this disclosure is not limited to particular
assembly or configuration or arrangement for achieving as
described, since it may vary within the specification indicated. It30
is further to be understood that the terminology used in the
description is only for the purpose of describing the particular
6
versions or embodiments and is not intended to limit the scope of5
the present invention.
[023] The words, “comprising”, “having”, “including” &
“containing” and other forms thereof, are intended to be
equivalent in meaning and be open ended in that an item or items
following any one of these words is not meant to be an exhaustive10
listing of such item or items or meant to be limited to only the
listed item or items.
[024] Figure 1 illustrates an exemplary conventional pile, in
accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Figure
1 shows the load transfer mechanism of a conventional pile. The15
load balancing equation is given by Q = Fs + Qb,
Q = load from the super structure,
Fs = frictional resistance, and
Qb = End bearing.
[025] The conventional pile transfers the load through two20
ways - by means of friction, Fs around the circumference of the
pile and end bearing Qb at the pile toe. However, the end bearing
component becomes very small when the soil is very soft clay, and
the entire load coming from the super-structure is borne by the
circumferential friction alone.25
[026] To overcome the problems of conventional pile, in the
present invention, the branches are incorporated into the pile
foundation to enhance its frictional resistance. This branched pile
aims to increase the surface area in contact with the surrounding
soil, thereby improving the pile's ability to resist lateral forces and30
reduce settlement under load. The branches, extending from the
main shaft of the pile, create additional frictional forces as the pile
is driven into the ground. This results in a more stable foundation
7
system, especially in soils with lower bearing capacities, ensuring5
better load distribution and greater overall structural integrity.
[027] Figure 2 illustrates an exemplary branched pile (BP),
in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The
BP as shown in the Figure 2 includes a first plurality of branches
(202) and a second plurality of branches (204). The branches10
(202, 204) are incorporated to the pile to form the Branched Pile
Foundation in order to increase the frictional resistance by
increasing the contact area with the adjacent soil and thereby
improving the bearing capacity of the pile. The increase in load
carrying capacity is shown in Fig 2. The new load transfer equation15
is given by:
Q = Fs + Qb + ∑ 𝑓𝑠𝑖𝑛
𝑖=1
n = number of branches20
fsi = frictional resistance of ith branch
[028] Figure 3 illustrates an exemplary branched pile (BP)
with different components, in accordance with an embodiment of
the present invention. In an embodiment, the BP (200) comprises
the first plurality of branches (202) at a top portion of the BP25
(200). The BP (200) having a length L and a diameter D. The BP
further having a diameter Df at the top portion of the BP (100)
forming frustum of a cone shaped. The BP further having height
Hf = 2D of the frustum of a cone shape at the upper portion of the
pile (200).30
[029] In an embodiment, the plurality of branches (202,
204) having a diameter Db. The length of the top branches is Ltb
which are inclined at an angle of α with the vertical (200). In an
8
embodiment, a length of the bottom branches is Lbb which are5
inclined at angle of β with the vertical (200).
[030] Figures 4A-4D illustrate an exemplary the
installation method of the BP (200) with two branches at the top
and bottom, in accordance with an embodiment of the present
invention. The bore hole is first dug out to the required dimensions10
of length, L and diameter, D as shown in Fig. 4A. The top of the
dug bore hole is then further excavated to form a frustum of a
cone shape to a required dimension. This is done to enable the
easy installation of the top and bottom branches as shown in Fig.
4B. The bore hole is then further bored for the installation of15
bottom branches to the original pile in the required directions
equally spaced as shown in Fig. 4C. The bore hole for the top
branch pile is then bored for the installation of the top branches
of the pile in the required directions. Different directions for top
and bottom branches are adopted in such a way that the20
reinforcement provided for the top and bottom branches do not
coincide as shown in Fig. 4(D). Reinforcement is placed for the
main pile and for the branches as shown in Fig. 3. Placement of
reinforcement in the branches reduces the possibility of
detachment during loading. Concreting to the main pile and its25
branches is then carried out.
[031] The Branched Pile (200) is an innovative solution that
stands out from traditional pile systems due to the incorporation
of branches (202, 204) into the pile structure (200). This structure
(200) aims to enhance the frictional resistance of the pile, making30
it more effective in transferring loads to the surrounding soil. The
addition of branches (202, 204) creates more surface area in
9
contact with the soil, leading to an increase in the pile’s load-5
carrying capacity.
[032] One of the key advantages of the branched pile over
existing solutions, such as root piles and belled piles, is the
construction process. In root piles, the roots are constructed at a
right angle to the pile shaft, making it difficult to accurately form10
them in the field. This leads to construction challenges and
potential failure of the roots during load transfer. In contrast, the
branches in the branched pile are constructed at an angle other
than 90 degrees, making it easier to drill the holes with an auger,
even in soft soils. For very soft soils, a casing pipe can be inserted15
to ensure the stability of the hole during construction, which
eliminates the issues of root pile construction.
[033] Once the hole for the branch is drilled, a reinforcement
of appropriate diameter is inserted into the hole. This
reinforcement provides additional strength to the branches and20
ensures that they can effectively withstand the shear forces during
load transfer. The reinforcement plays a critical role in preventing
the branches from breaking or failing under the applied loads, a
common issue with root piles. By using reinforcement in this
manner, the branched pile system ensures better load distribution25
and stability compared to traditional solutions.
[034] Another notable feature of the branched pile is the
design of the pile head at the top portion (200a). The top portion
(200a) of the pile is shaped like a cone, with the cone angle
matching the inclination angle of the branches, denoted by β. This30
cone-shaped design is not just for structural stability; it also
enhances the construction process. The angle of the cone allows
for efficient drilling and ensures that the branches are aligned
10
properly with the pile shaft. After the hole is made, the5
reinforcement bar is inserted, and concrete is poured to form the
branches, solidifying the pile's structure and providing additional
strength.
[035] The cone-shaped pile head at the top portion (200a)
serves a dual purpose. Not only does it facilitate the drilling and10
construction of the branches, but it also contributes to the overall
load capacity of the pile. The cone shape helps distribute the
applied loads more efficiently, allowing for better stress
distribution across the pile and surrounding soil. This leads to
improved stability and greater resistance to settlement under15
load, making the branched pile foundation more reliable and
effective compared to conventional pile systems.
[036] Table.1. shows a comparison in the ultimate bearing
capacity (qu) of the Conventional pile (CP) and Branched piles (BP)
(200) for different lengths. It can be seen that when the length of20
the CP and BP are 400 mm and diameter as 30 mm, the ultimate
bearing capacity of the BP is increased by 32%, 38% and 67% for
branches of length 45 mm, 60 mm and 75 mm respectively with
two branches at top as well as bottom.

[038] The bearing capacity of the model piles are found out5
by conducting static load on the model piles installed in soft peat
soil in the tank. Accordingly, the capacity is calculated by plotting
the load vs. settlement curve as in Fig. 6. Table 2 depicts the safe
bearing capacity of the pile from the load vs. settlement curve
indicating that for the same bearing capacity, the length of the10
conventional pile would have increased greatly. Table. 3. shows
the comparison between the length of the CP and BP for the same
bearing capacity, whereby it is observed the length of the
conventional pile is greater than that of conventional pile by 30%,
82.5% and 100% for achieving a bearing capacity of 189 N, 19815
N and 239 N respectively. Table. 4 shows the comparison of the
material consumption between CP & BP for the same pile capacity
whereby it is observed that the quantity of the cement required
for the construction of the branched pile is less than that is
required for the construction of conventional pile by 29%, 51%20
and 65% for achieving bearing capacity of 189 N, 198 N and 239
N respectively, thereby making the branched pile foundation very
economical compared to the conventional pile. However, an extra
quantity of reinforcement is required for the construction of the
branches.25

[042] The construction technique for the branched pile is5
based on modifying the conventional pile system by incorporating
angled branches. The process begins with the formation of a
frustum-shaped cone at the top of the pile, which facilitates the
easy installation of the bottom branches. The enlarged top portion
enables the precise location and positioning of the branches, both10
at the top and the bottom. This design provides greater flexibility,
allowing the branches to be positioned as needed to optimize load-
bearing capacity and ensure stability.
[043] The formation and installation of the branches, both
top and bottom, are key components of the branched pile. These15
branches are inclined at a specific angle to maximize their
interaction with the surrounding soil, improving the pile's frictional
resistance and overall load capacity. The alignment and
arrangement of the branches are carefully planned to ensure that
the load distribution is uniform and effective, further enhancing20
the pile’s performance. This system is particularly advantageous
in conditions where other pile types may not perform as
effectively.
[044] The branched pile system offers several benefits,
particularly in applications where heavy loads need to be25
supported, and other pile systems may fail. It is versatile and can
be implemented across a wide range of soil conditions, including
those with low bearing capacities. Additionally, this pile system is
ideal for use in the construction of low-rise buildings or structures
on deep-seated soft to very soft clay soils, making it a reliable30
foundation solution in challenging ground conditions.
14
[045] Technical advantages of the invention:5
• Enhanced Load-Bearing Capacity: The branched pile system
significantly improves load-bearing capacity by increasing
the contact surface area between the pile and the
surrounding soil. This enhancement is achieved through10
both frictional resistance and end bearing, as the branches
provide additional surface area for interaction with the soil.
Additionally, the larger diameter at the top of the pile and
the anchorage effect from the staggered arrangement of the
branches further augment the overall bearing capacity,15
enabling the pile to handle greater loads.
• Simple and Efficient Construction: One of the key technical
advantages of the branched pile is the simplicity of
constructing the branches compared to other pile systems,
such as underreamed piles and root piles. Unlike20
underreamed piles, which require complex bulb formation
that is often difficult to achieve, or root piles that are
challenging to construct accurately in the field, the branches
of the branched pile can be easily drilled and constructed at
a specified angle. This results in a more efficient and less25
error-prone construction process.
• Versatile and Flexible Design: The frustum-shaped top
portion of the branched pile offers greater flexibility in
positioning the bottom branches. The conical shape allows
for adjustable placement of the branches, enabling30
customization based on specific load requirements or soil
conditions. This versatility ensures that the pile can be
15
designed and installed to optimize performance in a variety5
of ground conditions.
• Improved Stability and Shear Resistance: The staggered
arrangement of branches provides a structural advantage in
terms of shear resistance. The branches create a more
uniform distribution of forces, enhancing the stability of the10
pile during load transfer. This staggered design minimizes
the risk of localized failure and ensures that the shear forces
are shared effectively among the branches and the main pile
shaft.
• Reduced Risk of Construction Failures: Unlike other pile15
systems that face significant risks of failure during
construction (such as collapsing bulbs in underreamed piles
or breakage of roots in root piles), the branched pile system
mitigates these issues through its straightforward design.
The use of reinforcement within the branches further20
strengthens the pile, ensuring that it can withstand load-
bearing demands without experiencing failure in the branch
structure.
• Increased Anchorage and Soil Penetration: The angled
branches, in combination with the larger diameter at the top25
of the pile, improve the anchorage effect in the soil. This
results in better soil penetration and load distribution,
particularly in soft or loose soils where traditional piles may
struggle. The increased anchorage further enhances the
overall stability and longevity of the foundation system,30
making it suitable for a wide range of soil conditions.

Field of the invention
[0001] The present invention relates to an electronic fuze. More
specifically, the present invention relates to an electronic safety fuze for detonation
of ammunition.
Background of the invention:5
[0002] The safety, precision, effectiveness and reliability of the
ammunition has been predominant and top priority in the domain of weapons. One
of the core components to attain the above goals are fuzes. The fuzes are
sophisticated devices designed to regulate the detonation of ammunition. The fuzes
must ensure the ammunition detonate at correct moment to prevent accidental10
detonation and loss of human life.
[0003] Chemical fuzes or percussion fuzes are prominent for
detonation of ammunition. The chemical fuzes rely on chemical reaction that is
triggered on the impact which initiates detonation. Chemical fuzes provide a
reliable and straightforward detonation mechanism. The simplicity of design and15
use had made them a reliable choice in munitions. However, the chemical fuzes
have limitations.
[0004] Chemical fuzes lack programmability and flexibility. The time
of the detonation of the chemical fuzes is fixed and cannot be altered. Once the fuze
is set, it is difficult to adapt to dynamic battlefield conditions.20
[0005] The modern applications of fuzes require precise detonation
timings and the fixed timing of chemical fuzes can lead to delayed or early
detonations, hence reducing their effectiveness in scenario of dynamic
environment.
[0006] The performance of the chemical fuzes is also influenced by25
environmental factors such as temperature, humidity and altitude. The fuzes rely
on chemical reactions that may depend on the environmental conditions and vary
speed, leading to inconsistency in detonation timing.
[0007] Also, chemical fuzes are susceptible to vibration and
mechanical shock, which may cause accidental detonation when mishandled and30
thus are unable to be used in dynamic combat environments.
3
[0008] To overcome the limitations of the chemical fuzes, electronic
fuzes were developed to provide precision, flexibility and adaptability. Fuzes have
been evolved from simple chemical and mechanical fuzes to advanced electronic
fuzes to fulfill the growing demands of modern warfare.
[0009] Generally, existing electronic fuzes are programmable and5
reliable for detonation in dynamic and complex situations. The existing electronic
fuzes are crucial for fulfilling the evolving needs of modern warfare and adjust
detonation timings. However, the existing electronic fuzes are complex in design.
[0010] Usually, existing electronic fuzes have fail-safe operations to
ensure detonation at precise and right situations. However, the operations may be10
susceptible to failure and accidental detonation if not tested and operated as
prescribed. The unintended detonation of the ammunition may lead to loss of
human life. Also, premature operation of fuze for detonation of the ammunition
may be risky for personnel around, launch equipment and during projectile
trajectory.15
[0011] Further, electronic fuzes should initiate detonation at specific
time or in certain conditions. But existing electronic fuzes have variable time delay
due to factors such as environmental changes, power supply needs, malfunction,
which leads to premature detonation or misfiring.
[0012] Therefore, there is a need for an electronic safety fuze for20
detonation of ammunition to overcome a few or all drawbacks of the existing
technologies.

Summary of the Invention
[0019] The present invention describes an electronic safety fuze for
detonation of ammunition. The electronic safety fuze comprises a housing having
an electrical path along an inner periphery of the housing, a printed circuit board
arranged in the housing having a conducting plane, a battery arranged within the10
housing, configured to power the printed circuit board through the electrical path
on firing, a first conducting block disposed within the housing, adapted to move
between a non-engaging position and an engaging position due to centrifugal force,
an insulating block arranged within the housing, to restrict the movement of the
first conducting block, to isolate the first conducting block from the electrical path15
of the electronic safety fuze in an inactive state, wherein the insulating block is
movable away from the first conducting block, to allow the movement of the first
conducting block towards the engaging position upon firing to establish an
electrical connection through the electrical path, a second conducting block
arranged within the housing, connected to a conducting plane of the printed circuit20
board and making a signal to a microcontroller unit, wherein, upon an impact on
the electronic safety fuze, the second conducting block disengages from the
conducting plane to break the signal thereby alerting the microcontroller unit of the
printed circuit board about detection of the impact and further the microcontroller
unit either triggers an electric detonator or enter self-destruction mode.25
[0020] The first conducting block is positioned in the housing within
a channel, to move towards the periphery of the housing, between the non-engaging
position and the engaging position. The insulating block rests on a first spring
within a channel during the inactive state to restrict the movement of the first
conducting block between the non-engaging position and the engaging position30
towards periphery of the housing.
5
[0021] On firing of the ammunition, the insulating block moves away
from the first conducting block due to recoil force in direction transverse to the axis
of movement of the first conducting block by compression of a first spring and
thereby allowing the movement of the first conducting block towards the engaging
position to establish an electrical connection by means of the electrical path.5
[0022] The insulating block retracts towards a channel to lock the
movement of the first conducting block in the engaging position as soon as the
recoil force is removed after firing of the ammunition, thereby establishing
continuous electrical connection through the electrical path for powering the
printed circuit board on and after the firing and the impact.10
[0023] The second conducting block arranged within the housing is
connected to the conducting plane of the printed circuit board making a signal to
the microcontroller unit. The second conducting block is attached to a second
spring within a conduit, wherein on the impact, the second conducting block
disengages and moves away from the conducting plane of the printed circuit board15
by compression of the second spring to break the signal thereby alerting the
microcontroller unit about detection of the impact.
[0024] The microcontroller unit is configured to initiate self-
destruction if the impact is not detected within a predefined time or if the impact is
detected within the predefined time but is within a predefined safety distance.20
[0025] The printed circuit board is programmed to control the
detonation of the ammunition based on the impact detection within the predefined
time.
[0026] The printed circuit board has a switch actuated through the
alert of the impact detection, to activate the electric detonator or activate the self-25
destruction mode.
[0027] In an aspect, a method for operating an electronic safety fuze
for detonation of ammunition is provided. The method comprises the steps of,
maintaining the electronic safety fuze in an inactive state by arranging an insulating
block within the housing, to restrict the movement of a first conducting block in an30
non-engaging position, and to interrupt electrical current flow from a battery to a
6
printed circuit board by means of an electrical path; activating the electronic safety
fuze by firing, leading to movement of the insulating block away from the first
conducting block, further establishing an electrical connection between the battery
and the printed circuit board by means of the electrical path, by allowing the
movement of the first conducting block by centrifugal force to an engaging position5
towards the periphery of the housing., detecting an impact on the electronic safety
fuze, wherein a second conducting block disengages from a conducting plane of
the printed circuit board to break the signal thereby alerting the microcontroller
unit about detection of the impact . Further, detonating the ammunition through an
electric detonator if the impact is detected within a predefined time.10
[0028] The printed circuit board includes a microcontroller unit to
measure the predefined time.
[0029] The microcontroller unit is adapted to measure the safety
distance after detecting the impact within the predefined time, wherein if the impact
is detected beyond the predefined safety distance, the ammunition is detonated by15
means of the electric detonator.
[0030] If the impact is detected within the predefined safety distance,
the microcontroller unit activates the self-destruction mode after the predefined
time has passed.
[0031] If the impact is not detected, the microcontroller unit activates20
self-destruction mode if the time exceeds the predefined time.

[0039] The present invention describes an electronic safety fuze for15
detonation of ammunition. The electronic safety fuze is compact in design to
prevent accidental detonations. The electronic safety fuze is programmed to
achieve precise detonation control and enhanced reliability. The electronic safety
fuze can withstand harsh environmental conditions. Also, the electronic safety fuze
is adapted to operate in dynamic combat scenarios.20
[0040] The terms “first”. “second”, and the like, herein do not denote
any order, quantity, or importance, but rather are used to distinguish one element
from another, and the terms “a” and “an” herein do not denote a limitation of
quantity, but rather denote the presence of at least one of the referenced item.
[0041] The disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the25
invention, which may be embodied in various forms.
[0042] Referring to Figure 1, an electronic safety fuze (100) in
accordance with the present invention is illustrated. The electronic safety fuze (100)
comprises a housing (110), a printed circuit board (120), a battery (130), a first
conducting block (140), an insulating block (150), and a second conducting block30
(160).
8
[0043] In the present embodiment, the housing (110) is cylindrical in
shape. The housing (120) accommodates the printed circuit board (120), the battery
(130), the first conducting block (140), the insulating block (150), and the second
conducting block (160). It may be obvious for a person skilled in the art to
configure the housing (110) of any shape including spherical, cuboidal, cube,5
spherocylinder, pentagonal prism or hexagonal prism.
[0044] The housing (110) is configured to have an electrical path
(210) along an inner periphery of the housing (110). The electrical path (210)
extends from the battery (130) towards the printed circuit board (120) in a
longitudinal direction of the housing (110) along the periphery and is in a10
disconnected state to restrict the power transmission in an inactive state of the
ammunition.
[0045] The printed circuit board (120) is arranged within the housing
(110), especially at a bottom portion (as shown in Figure 1) of the housing (110).
The printed circuit board (120) includes a conducting plane, a microcontroller unit15
(170), and a switch (180). The printed circuit board (120) is provided to control the
function of the electronic safety fuze (100).
[0046] The printed circuit board (120) is powered by the battery
(130). The battery (130) is arranged within the housing (110) to power the
components of the printed circuit board (120), by means of the electrical path (210).20
The battery (130) is positioned opposite to the printed circuit board (120) at a top
portion (as shown in Figure 1) in the housing (110). The battery (130) is connected
to the printed circuit board (120) through the electrical path (210) when the first
conducting block (140) engages with the electrical path (210). Initially, there is no
current flow from the battery (130) to the printed circuit board (120) through the25
electrical path (210). In the present embodiment, the battery (130) is a coin cell
battery. It may be obvious for a person skilled in the art to use any other type of
battery to satisfy the need and functionality.
[0047] The electronic safety fuze (100) operates in two states – first -
the inactive state, when the ammunition is stationery and second - an excited state,30
when the ammunition is fired. In the inactive state, the first conducting block (140),
9
the insulating block (150), and the second conducting block (160) remains
stationery and no current flows from the battery (130) towards the printed circuit
board (120). The excited state of the electronic safety fuze (100) starts from the
firing of the ammunition till the operation of detonation. In the excited state, the
battery (130) powers the printed circuit board (120).5
[0048] Now, referring again to figure 1, the electronic safety fuze
(100) comprises the first conducting block (140) arranged within the housing (110).
The first conducting block (140) is arranged in the housing (110) within a channel.
The first conducting block (140) is adapted to move within the channel between a
non-engaging position and an engaging position. The movement occurs within the10
channel due to centrifugal force acting on the first conducting block (140), when
the ammunition is fired and the electronic safety fuze (100) is in the excited state.
[0049] In the non-engaging position, the first conducting block (140)
is away from the electrical path (210). In the present embodiment, the first
conducting block (140) is arranged at a center of the housing (110) away from the15
electrical path (210) arranged on the inner periphery of the housing (110). In the
engaging position, the first conducting block (140) is in contact with the periphery
of the housing (110), thereby establishing an electrical connection between the
battery (130) and the printed circuit board (120) through the electrical path (210).
[0050] In the inactive state of the electronic safety fuze (100), the20
movement of the first conducting block (140) from the non-engaging position to
the engaging position is restricted by the insulating block (150). The insulating
block (150) isolates the first conducting block (140) from the electrical path (210).
[0051] Also in the inactive state, the insulating block (150) isolates
the electrical connection between the battery (130) and the printed circuit board25
(120) through the electrical path (210). The insulating block (150) prevents the flow
of current from the battery (130) towards the printed circuit board (120) in the
inactive state.
[0052] The insulating block (150) is arranged on a first spring (190)
to position the insulating block (150) within the channel, thereby restricting the30
movement of the first conducting block (140) from the non-engaging position to
10
the engaging position towards the inner periphery of the housing (110). The first
spring (190) remains stationery in the inactive state and holds the position of the
insulating block (150) in the channel by providing a restoring force. In the present
embodiment, the first spring (190) is a compression spring. It may be obvious for
a person skilled in the art to select any other type of a spring as the first spring (190)5
to achieve the functionality.
[0053] The insulating block (150) is movable away from the first
conducting block (140) due to recoil force in direction transverse to the axis of
movement of the first conducting block (140) by compression of the first spring
(190). In the excited state after firing, the insulting block moves away from the first10
conducting block (140) (as shown in Figure 2). The movement of the insulating
block (150) away from the first conducting block (140) allows the movement of
the first conducting block (140) towards the engaging position due to the
centrifugal force to establish the electrical connection between the battery (130)
and the printed circuit board (120) by means of the electrical path (210).15
[0054] On firing, the establishment of the electrical connection
through the electrical path (210) between the battery (130) and the printed circuit
board (120) powers up the printed circuit board (120).
[0055] The insulating block (150) ensures that the first conducting
block (140) does not unintentionally complete the electrical path (210) and power20
the printed circuit board (120) prematurely or accidently in the inactive state.
[0056] The insulating block (150) retracts towards the channel as
soon as the recoil force is removed after firing the ammunition, to lock the
movement of the first conducting block (140) in the engaging position (as shown
in Figure 3). The locking of the first conducting block (140) in the engaging25
position enables continuous electrical connection through the electrical path (210)
from the battery (130) to the printed circuit board (120) on and after the firing and
an impact.
[0057] The impact is detected by the second conducting block (160).
The second conducting block (160) is arranged within the housing (110) and30
connected to the conducting plane of the printed circuit board (120). The second
11
conducting block (160) remains stationery during the inactive state and is arranged
on a second spring (200) within a conduit and makes a signal to the microcontroller
unit (170).
[0058] Upon the impact on the electronic safety fuze (100), the
second spring (200) compresses to disengage the second conducting block (160)5
from the conducting plane of the printed circuit board (120). The second spring
(200) compresses on the impact, to move the second conducting block (160) away
from the conducting plane within the conduit (as shown in Figure 4). In the present
embodiment, the second spring (200) is a compression spring. It may be obvious
for a person skilled in the art to select any other type of spring as the second spring10
(200).
[0059] The second conducting block (160) disengages from the
conducting plane to break the signal thereby alerting the microcontroller unit (170)
of the printed circuit board (120) about detection of the impact.
[0060] The microcontroller unit (170) is adapted to either trigger an15
electric detonator or enter self-destruction mode on receiving the alert about
detection of the impact. The ammunition detonates through the triggering of the
electric detonator or through self-destruction mode based on the alert.
[0061] The microcontroller unit (170) is configured to initiate self-
destruction mode in two scenarios to prevent the accidental or hazardous detonation20
of the ammunition during the combat situation. The self-destruction mode enables
that the ammunition does not remain active or armed for long durations creating a
chance of accident and loss of human life in combat environment and area.
[0062] The printed circuit board (120) has a switch (180) actuated
through the alert of detection of the impact, to activate the electric detonator or25
activate the self -destruction mode.
[0063] The electric detonator is placed within the ammunition but
exterior to the electronic safety fuze (100). The electric detonator is activated on
receiving the alert of detection of the impact. The switch (180) on the printed circuit
board (120) is actuated through the alert of detection of the impact and allows a30
current flow through the electric detonator in order to detonate the ammunition.
12
[0064] In an embodiment, the electric detonator is a bridgewire
detonator surrounded by a small quantity of primary explosive (e.g., lead azide). A
protection casing may be present prevent accidental activation due to static
discharge or environmental conditions. The electric detonator is controlled via the
switch (180) on the printed circuit board (120), which completes the circuit to allow5
current flow from the battery to the bridgewire. When activated, an electric current
heats the bridgewire, causing the primary explosive to detonate. The electric
detonator may have a redundant safety interlock, preventing accidental current flow
unless explicitly triggered by the microcontroller unit and also it may have
overcurrent protection to prevent accidental detonation due to power surges. It may10
be obvious to a person skilled in the art to configure the electronic safety fuze (100)
with alternative types of electric detonators, such as semiconductor bridge
detonators (SCB), slapper detonators, or other suitable detonator technologies,
depending on the specific application requirements, safety standards, and
environmental conditions.15
[0065] The printed circuit board (120) is programmed to control the
detonation of the ammunition based on the detection of the impact within a
predefined time and a safety distance. The predefined time is the time from the
firing location of the ammunition, till the ammunition detonates.
[0066] The microcontroller unit (170) of the printed circuit board20
(120) calculates the predefined time after firing, especially, after the electrical
connection is established between the battery (130) and the printed circuit board
(120). The predefined time is provided to detect the impact within a time configured
by the user. If the impact is detected within the predefined time, the microcontroller
unit (170) measure the distance of the impact from the location of the firing. If the25
measured distance is beyond the predefined safety distance, the microcontroller
unit (170) activates the electric detonator to explode the ammunition instantly.
[0067] Further, if the impact is detected within the predefined time
and the measured distance is within the predefined safety distance, the
microcontroller unit (170) activates the self-destruction mode through the switch30
(180) to explode the ammunition.
13
[0068] Furthermore, if the impact is not detected within the
predefined time, the microcontroller unit (170) activates the self-destruction mode.
If the predefined time is exceeded and the impact is not detected by the second
conducting block (160), the switch (180) of the printed circuit board (120) initiate
to explode the ammunition instantly.5
[0069] In the present embodiment, the microcontroller unit (170) is
adapted to calculate a preset time after detection of the impact within the predefined
time. The preset time allows the microcontroller unit (170) to calculate the distance
of the impact from the location of the firing. The preset time is configured
according to the time required by the microcontroller unit (170) for processing the10
calculation of the distance. The preset time may ranges from 20 milliseconds to 30
milliseconds. In the preferred embodiment, the preset time is set to 21 milliseconds.
[0070] If the distance of the impact is within the predefined safety
distance, the microcontroller unit (170) activates the self-destruction mode, and if
the distance of the impact is beyond the predefined safety distance, the15
microcontroller unit (170) activates the electric detonator to explode the
ammunition instantly.
[0071] In an embodiment in case of failure of microcontroller unit, a
mechanical arming delay circuit ensures eventual detonation through passive
means (e.g., a burning delay fuse integrated as a redundancy).20
[0072] Referring now to figure 5, a method (300) for operation of an
electronic safety fuze (100) for detonation of ammunition is described. The method
is described in conjunction with the electronic safety fuze (100) as described above
in the paragraphs. The method (300) of operation comprises the steps:
[0073] The method (300) of operation starts at step (310).25
[0074] At Step (320), the electronic safety fuze (100) is maintained in
the inactive state by the insulating block (150) arranged within the housing (110),
to restrict the movement of the first conducting block (140) in the non-engaging
position, and to interrupt electrical current flow from the battery (130) to the printed
circuit board (120) by means of the electrical path (210).30
14
[0075] In the inactive state of the electronic safety fuze (100), the
insulating block (150) arranged within housing (110) is rested on the first spring
(190) to restrict the movement of the first conducting block (140) towards the inner
periphery of the housing (110). The insulating block (150) interrupts the flow of
electrical current from the battery (130) to the printed circuit board (120) by5
isolating the first conducting block (140) from the electrical path (210) in the non-
engaging position. In the inactive state, the first conducting block (140) is in the
non-engaging position.
[0076] The first spring (190) remains stationery in the inactive state
and holds the position of the insulating block (150) by providing a restoring force.10
[0077] Further at step (330), the electronic safety fuze (100) is
activated by firing. The firing of the ammunition leads to movement of the
insulating block (150) away from the first conducting block (140).
[0078] When the ammunition is fired, the electronic safety fuze (100)
activates by firing and is in the excited state. The firing leads to movement of the15
insulating block (150) away from the first conducting block (140). The movement
of insulating block (150) is due to recoil force experienced by the first spring (190)
which compresses on the firing.
[0079] The movement of the insulating block (150) away from the
first conducting block (140) allows the movement of the first conducting block20
(140) from the non-engaging position to the engaging position towards the
periphery of the housing (110) within the channel.
[0080] At Step (340), an electrical connection is established between
the battery (130) and the printed circuit board (120) by means of the electrical path
(210). On firing, the first conducting block (140) moves towards the periphery of25
the housing (110) to the engaging position by the centrifugal force to engage with
the electrical path (210). The engagement establishes the electrical connection
between the battery (130) and the printed circuit board (120) by means of the
electrical path (210). The electrical connection powers up the printed circuit board
(120).30
15
[0081] The microcontroller unit (170) counts the predefined time
from the firing. Moreover, at Step (350), the impact on the electronic safety fuze
(100) is detected using the second conducting block (160). The second conducting
block (160) is connected to the conducting plane of the printed circuit board (120)
and makes a signal to a microcontroller unit (170). Upon impact, the second5
conducting block (160) disengages from the conducting plane of the printed circuit
board (120) to break the signal thereby alerting the microcontroller unit (170) about
detection of the impact.
[0082] The alert of detection of the impact is sent to the
microcontroller unit (170).10
[0083] At subsequent step (360), the ammunition is detonated
through the electric detonator if impact is detected within the predefined time.
[0084] Specifically, if the impact is detected within the predefined
time, the microcontroller unit (170) calculates the distance of impact from the
location of the firing of the ammunition.15
[0085] In the above scenario, if the impact is detected within the
predefined time and the distance of the impact is beyond the predefined safety
distance, the microcontroller unit (170) actuates the switch (180) of the printed
circuit board (120) thereby activating the electric detonator to detonate the
ammunition by passing a current flow to the electric detonator.20
[0086] If the impact is not detected within the predefined time, the
microcontroller unit (170) activates self-destruction mode. The ammunition is
detonated by self-destruction mode.
[0087] The method (300) of operation ends at step (370).
[0088] In order to have effective operation of the electronic safety25
fuze (100) and prevent the consequence of accidental detonation of the
ammunition, the electronic safety fuze (100) is equipped with self-destruction
mode which detonates the ammunition in self-destruction mode in two scenarios.
[0089] The detonation of the ammunition by means of self-
destruction mode prevents the lying down of active or armed ammunition in the30
16
combat scenario for long durations. Also, the detonation through self-destruction
can prevent loss of human life during real time and dynamic combat situations.
[0090] The two scenarios of detonation of the ammunition by self-
destruction mode is described below.
[0091] In the first scenario, if the impact is detected within the5
predefined time and if the distance of the impact is within the predefined safety
distance from the location of firing, the microcontroller unit (170) activates the self-
destruction mode after the predefined time. The ammunition detonates in self-
destruction mode after the predefined time has passed.
[0092] Further in another scenario, if the impact is not detected, the10
microcontroller unit (170) activates the self-destruction mode if the time exceeds
the predefined time. The ammunition detonates in the self-destruction mode after
the predefined time has passed.
[0093] An illustrative example is described below for the method
(300) for operation of the electronic safety fuze (100) for detonation of15
ammunition, not limiting the scope of the invention.
[0094] The ammunition is stationery. The electronic safety fuze
(100) within the ammunition is in the inactive state. The battery (130) and the
printed circuit board (120) within the housing (110) have no electrical connection
during the inactive state.20
[0095] The insulating block (150) in the electronic safety fuze (100)
restricts the movement of the first conducting block (140) and interrupts the current
flow from the battery (130) to the printed circuit board (120) through the electrical
path (210). The first conducting block (140) is in the non-engaging position during
the inactive state within the channel.25
[0096] The ammunition is fired from the location, which activates the
electronic safety fuze (100) and is in the excited state. The firing leads to the
movement of the insulating block (150) away from the first conducting block (140)
by recoil force experienced by the compression of the first spring (190). The
centrifugal force acts on the first conducting block (140) during firing to move the30
17
first conducting block (140) to the engaging position towards the inner periphery
of the housing (110).
[0097] The first conducting block (140) establishes the electrical
connection between the battery (130) and the printed circuit board (120) by means
of the electrical path (210). The microcontroller unit (170) on the printed circuit5
board (120) is activated to calculate the predefined time. The predefined time may
range from 9 seconds to 13 seconds. In the present embodiment, the predefined
time has been set to 13 seconds.
[0098] The second conducting block (160) is connected to the
conducting plane of the printed circuit board (120) and makes a signal to the10
microcontroller unit (170). Upon the impact on the electronic safety fuze (100), the
second conducting block (160) disengages from the conducting plane of the printed
circuit board (120) to break the signal thereby alerting the microcontroller unit
(170) about detection of the impact.
[0099] If the impact on the electronic safety fuze (100) is detected15
within the predefined time that is 15 seconds, the distance of the impact is measured
from the location of firing of the ammunition by the microcontroller unit (170), and
if the distance of the impact is beyond the predefined safety distance, the
ammunition is detonated through the electric detonator.
[00100] If the impact on the electronic safety fuze (100) is detected20
within the predefined time that is 15 seconds, the distance of the impact is measured
from the location of the firing by the microcontroller unit (170), and if the distance
of the impact is within the predefined safety distance from the location of the firing
of the ammunition, the microcontroller unit (170) detonates the ammunition by the
self-destruction mode after the predefined time has passed.25
[00101] If the impact is not detected on the electronic safety fuze (100)
within the predefined time, the microcontroller unit (170) activates self-destruction
mode and detonates instantly.
[00102] The electronic safety fuze (100) has consistent and precise
detonation time. The use of microcontroller unit (170) ensures reliable performance30
in dynamic combat scenarios.
18
[00103] The electronic safety fuze (100) is compact in design and size
to ensure safe handling and prevent accidental detonations. The arrangement of the
insulating block (150) within the electronic safety fuze (100) for restricting the
movement of the first conducting block (140) prevents the accidental electrical
connection between the battery (130) and the printed circuit board (120) and in turn5
prevents accidental detonation in the inactive state.
[00104] The accidental detonation may refer to the unintentional
ignition of the ammunition. The causes of the accidental detonation may be
defective design of fuze, manufacturing errors, malfunction of fuze due to extreme
environmental conditions, improper handling or storage.10
[00105] The construction of the electronic safety fuze (100) is robust
to withstand harsh environmental conditions while storage and operation. The
electronic safety fuze (100) is designed to operate within specified speed
parameters, including traveling and rotation speeds, optimizing its performance
under various velocities and spin conditions.15
[00106] The foregoing descriptions of specific embodiments of the
present invention have been presented for purposes of illustration and description.
They are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the present invention to the
precise forms disclosed, and obviously, many modifications and variations are
possible in light of the above teaching. The embodiments were chosen and20

Abstract
Title: An Electronic Safety Fuze for Detonation of Ammunition and a
Method of Operation
The present invention describes an electronic safety fuze (100) for detonation of
ammunition, comprising a housing (110), a printed circuit board (120), a battery5
(130) to power the printed circuit board (120) by an electrical path (210). A first
conducting block (140) is adapted to move between a non-engaging position and
an engaging position, while an insulating block (150) restricts the movement of
first conducting block (140) in inactive state. Upon firing of the ammunition, the
insulating block (150) moves far from first conducting block (140), allowing the10
first conducting block (140) to engage with engaging position and powering the
printed circuit board (120) through the electrical path (210). A second conducting
block (160) detects an impact on the electronic safety fuze (100) by disengaging
from the printed circuit board (120), thereby alerting the microcontroller unit (170)
to either trigger an electric detonator or enter self-destruction mode.15

ABSTRACT
A cable device includes an integrated Surge protection
circuit. In the event that, communication signals conveyed
by the cable include (potentially damaging) transient Volt
ages, the Surge protection circuit integrated in the cable
Suppresses the transient Voltages at a distance from a cor
responding electronic circuit to which the cable is attached.
Consequently, potentially damaging Voltage transients
imparted on the communication signals are clamped before
reaching potentially sensitive inputs of the electronic circuit.

unless specifically authorised in writing by the LICENSEE to do so. )

violation, damage or discredit of the Trademark, nor register any name which could be
confusingly similar to the Trademark or any other trademarks, trade names, or designs
owned by the LICENSOR. In addition, the LICENSEE shall not use on or in connection
with any goods any trade mark so nearly resembling the Trademark as to be likely to
cause deception or confusion.

infringements, suspected infringements or violation of rights in relation to the

actions shall be taken. The LICENSEE shall give the LICENSOR its full co-operation
and assistance in the defence of its rights in relation to the Trademark. Any expenses

LICENSEE, upon request, can be entitled by the LICENSOR to defend the Trademark
at its own name and costs.
16) The relationship of the LICENSOR and the LICENSEE shall at all times be deemed
to be of independent contractors. By virtue of this Agreement, neither Party shall be
deemed to be the other Party's partner, joint venturer, legal representative or agent and
therefore the LICENSOR and the LICENSEE shall have no power, express or implied,
to legally represent the other or any authority to enter into contracts on each other's
behalf. Furthermore, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as qualifying
LICENSEE's salesmen and collaborators as LICENSOR's employees or agents.

own data be inserted in their respective database for the administrative, technical and
accounting management of the Agreement itself. The Parties also allow each other to
supply said data to third parties, to extent that such communication may be necessary
for the fulfilment of the rights and obligations related to the execution of this

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
1. Field of the Invention
The present invention relates generally to error detection
in high speed data transmission systems and components.
More particularly, embodiments of the present invention
concern error rate testing methods and devices suitable for
use in connection with various network protocols and con
figurations.
2. Related Technology
Computer and data communications networks continue to
proliferate due to declining costs, increasing performance of
computer and networking equipment, and increasing
demand for communication bandwidth. Communications
networks including wide area networks (“WANs) and
local area networks (“LANs)—allow increased productiv
ity and utilization of distributed computers or stations
through the sharing of resources, the transfer of voice and
data, and the processing of Voice, data and related informa
tion at the most efficient locations. Moreover, as organiza
tions have recognized the economic benefits of using com
munications networks, network applications such as
electronic mail, Voice and data transfer, host access, and
shared and distributed databases are increasingly used as a
means to increase user productivity. This increased demand,
together with the growing number of distributed computing
resources, has resulted in a rapid expansion of the number of
installed networks.
As the demand for networks has grown, network tech
nology has developed to the point that many different
physical configurations presently exist. Examples include
Gigabit Ethernet (“GE), 10 GE, Fiber Distributed Data
Interface (“FDDI), Fibre Channel (“FC), Synchronous
Optical Network (“SONET) and InfiniBand networks.
These networks, and others, typically conform to one of a
variety of established standards, or protocols, which set forth
rules that govern network access as well as communications
between and among the network resources. Typically, Such
networks utilize different cabling systems, have different
characteristic bandwidths and typically transmit data at
different speeds. Network bandwidth, in particular, has been
the driving consideration behind many advancements in the
area of high speed communication systems, methods and
devices.
For example, the ever-increasing demand for network
bandwidth has resulted in the development of technology
that increases the amount of data that can be pushed through
a single channel on a network. Advancements in modulation
techniques, coding algorithms and error correction have
vastly increased the rates at which data can be transmitted
across networks. For example, a few years ago, the highest
rate that data could travel across a network was at about one
Gigabit per second. This rate has increased to the point

where data can travel across Ethernet and SONET networks
at rates as high as 10 gigabits per second, or faster.
As communication networks have increased in size, speed
and complexity however, they have become increasingly
likely to develop a variety of problems that, in practice, have
proven difficult to diagnose and resolve. Such problems are
of particular concern in light of the continuing demand for
high levels of network operational reliability and for
increased network capacity.
The problems generally experienced in network commu
nications can take a variety of forms and may occur as a
result of a variety of different circumstances. Examples of
circumstances, conditions and events that may give rise to
network communication problems include the transmission
of unnecessarily Small frames of information, inefficient or
incorrect routing of information, improper network configu
ration and Superfluous network traffic, to name just a few.
Such problems are aggravated by the fact that networks are
continually changing and evolving due to growth, recon
figuration and introduction of new network typologies and
protocols. Moreover, new network interconnection devices
and Software applications are constantly being introduced
and implemented. Circumstances such as these highlight the
need for effective, reliable and flexible diagnostic and reme
dial systems, methods and devices.
Consequently, as high speed data communications sys
tems, processes and devices mature, many designs have
increasingly focused on reliability and performance issues.
One area of particular interest concerns the detection of
errors, and determination of a corresponding error rate, for
network systems and devices. Among other things, reliable
and accurate error rate measurement during the develop
ment, manufacturing and installation of high speed networks
and associated systems and devices is useful because it gives
administrators and other personnel the capability to readily
and precisely detect and correct problems, thereby helping to
ensure the integrity of the data transmitted and processed by
the network and associated devices.
To that end, various equipment, systems and methods
have been developed that are used to determine an error rate
along a particular data transmission path. In some instances,
it is useful to determine the error rate on a bit and/or word
basis. Thus, error rate testers and other systems and equip
ment have been developed that are employed to determine a
bit error rate along a particular path on a network.
Generally, bit error rate testers operate by transmitting a
predetermined bit sequence onto the network path, and then
analyzing the predetermined bit sequence when it returns to
the bit error rate tester. Typically, such analyses involve
comparing the received bit sequence to a copy of the bit
sequence that was initially transmitted onto the network.
This comparison permits errors within the sequence to be
identified and counted. After the errors in the bit sequence
are counted, that information is used to calculate an overall
bit error rate. Depending upon the particular value of the bit
error rate, various remedial, or other, actions may then be
implemented.
While such bit error testers have proven effective in some
applications, they have nonetheless proven rather limited in
terms of their ability to effectively adapt to the myriad of
different, and evolving, network types and protocols. By
way of example, conventional bit error rate testers are
generally only effective when used in connection with
network paths having certain configurations.
More particularly, many network devices drop or add
idles or filler words to a data stream in order to maintain
synchronization of the data within the stream. This situation
US 7,231,558 B2

is commonly encountered when a variety of network
devices, each using a different clock, reside on a single
network path. However, the bit sequence comparison pro
cedures employed by typical bit error rate testers are not
configured to compensate in any way for Such idle or filler
word modifications to the data stream. Consequently, once
Such a modification occurs, the received bit sequence
becomes unsynchronized with the test bit sequence, invali
dating the bit error rate test from that point forward.
Thus, network paths intended to be tested with known
error rate testers generally must be clear of any networking
device that could modify the data stream in which the
transmitted test bit sequence was traveling. Restrictions such
as these sharply constrain the usefulness of the testing
device.
Advancements and changes in network protocols have
likewise complicated network error testing and diagnostic
processes. For example, the movement from the GE to 10
GE protocol has introduced some unique problems that have
not been adequately resolved. One such problem relates to
the manner whereby the physical layer encodes data for
physical transmission on the network. In particular, devel
opers had initially anticipated that the 8 B: 10 B code from
Gigabit Ethernet could likewise be employed in connection
with the 10 GE protocol. However, it is difficult to operate
directly modulated lasers, such as are commonly employed
in high speed networks, at the 12.5 Gbd data rate required to
accommodate the 25% overhead of 8 B:10 B coding. There
fore, a more efficient coding method, known as 64/66 b, was
devised. This reduces the coding overhead to approximately
3% and makes cost-effective 10 Gbit transceiver systems
feasible. However, known test systems do not accommodate
this coding method and are therefore unable to decode
protocol data, which is necessary to compensate for modi
fications to the data stream since these occur at the protocol
level.
In view of the foregoing, it would be useful to provide an
error rate tester that is not constrained for use with particular
network paths or configurations. Among other things, the
error rate tester should be able to compensate for modifica
tions to the data stream in which the transmitted test bit
sequence travels. In this regard, it would be useful for the
error rate tester to be able to identify when a bit sequence has
become unsynchronized due to the insertion or deletion of a
fill word, re-synchronize that bit sequence, and then perform
an error rate test on the re-synchronized sequence. Further
more, the error rate tester should support multiple protocols
So as to enable effective and efficient testing, by a single
tester, of networks conforming to a variety of different
protocols, including networks with line speeds as high as 10
gigabits per second, or higher. Finally, the error rate tester
should be capable of identifying and tracking errors at both
the bit and word levels in the datastream.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF AN EXEMPLARY
EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION
In general, embodiments of the invention generally relate
to error detection in high speed data transmission systems
and components. More particularly, embodiments of the
present invention relate to error rate testing methods and
devices suitable for use in connection with various network
protocols and configurations.
In general, the error rate tester is used to test the integrity
of paths within a network by transmitting a test bit sequence
onto the path and then analyzing the sequence after it returns
to the error rate tester. In one exemplary implementation, an

error rate tester is provided that includes multiple network
interfaces so that the error rate tester may be used in
connection with a variety of different types of networks. In
this implementation, a single error rate tester is configured
to Support multiple 10 Gigabit/second asynchronous proto
cols.
This exemplary error rate tester includes a sequence
generator in communication with a memory device and a
first communication port, as well as a detect module in
communication with a second communication port. The
detect module also communicates with a synchronization
module that, in turn, communicates with a comparator
whose output is directed to a statistics and counters module
that tracks the number of bit and/or word errors that have
occurred.
With respect to exemplary operational characteristics of
this implementation of the error rate tester, a bit-by-bit
analysis is performed by the error rate tester on a received
test bit sequence in order to determine the number of bit and
word errors in the sequence. The error rate tester is also able
to determine whether a received bit sequence is synchro
nized, and if it is not, re-synchronize the bit sequence
preparatory to determining the error rate.
More particularly, the sequence generator creates a test bit
sequence that will be used for testing the error rate of a
network path. The test bit sequence is generated using
pre-stored data within the memory device, or may alterna
tively be generated according to a pre-defined polynomial,
so that the bit sequence can be regenerated at a receiver side
of the error rate tester. The created test bit sequence is
transmitted onto a network path by way of the first com
munication port, and returned to the bit error rate tester by
way of the second communication port. The synchronization
module receives the test bit sequence from the network and
ensures that the test bit sequence is bit-aligned. If necessary,
the synchronization module compensates for any fill words
added or dropped by the device, or devices, under test.
The synchronized bit sequence is then passed to the
comparator which uses the received bit sequence to deter
mine the bit error rate of the tested network path. More
particularly, the received bit sequence is compared to the test
bit sequence that was pre-stored in the memory prior to
transmission onto the network. The comparator counts the
number of errors within the received bit sequence and
calculated the corresponding bit error rate.
The foregoing, and other, aspects of exemplary embodi
ments of the invention will become more fully apparent
from the following description and appended claims.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SELECTED
EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION
Reference will now be made to the drawings to describe
various aspects of exemplary embodiments of the invention.
It is to be understood that the drawings are diagrammatic and
schematic representations of Such exemplary embodiments,
and are not limiting of the present invention, nor are they
necessarily drawn to scale. Moreover, while various head
ings are employed in the following discussion, such head
ings are included solely for the purpose of organizing and
facilitating the disclosure hereof and are not intended, nor
should they be construed, to define the invention or limit the
Scope of the invention in any way.
I. General Description of Aspects of An Exemplary Opera
tional Setup
With attention first to FIG. 1, details are provided con
cerning an exemplary operational setup wherein a bit error
rate tester (“BERT), designated generally at 100, is
employed. Note that while the terms "BERT and bit error
rate tester are used herein in order to facilitate the discus
Sion, the scope of the invention is not limited to systems,
methods and devices that test only bit error rates but, as
discussed elsewhere herein, contemplates systems, methods
and devices for use in error rate testing at the bit and/or word
level as well. Likewise ‘error rate tester includes systems,
methods and devices for use in error rate testing at the bit
and/or word level.
In the illustrated implementation, the BERT 100 is
employed in connection with a network 200. The network
200 may comprise any network, and associated protocol, in
connection with which the employment of embodiments of
the BERT 100 may prove useful. For example, various
embodiments of the BERT 100 are suited for use in con
nection with a variety of network 200 types and protocols
including both synchronous and asynchronous network pro
tocols, examples of which include, but are not limited to,
Gigabit Ethernet (“GE), 10 GE, Fiber Distributed Data
Interface (“FDDI), Fibre Channel (“FC) and 10 G Fibre
Channel, Synchronous Optical Network (“SONET) and 10
G SONET, and x4 InfiniBand, among others.
As discussed in further detail below, exemplary embodi
ments of the BERT 100 are configured so that compatibility
with several network types and protocols is implemented
within a single BERT 100. In one such exemplary imple
mentation, a single BERT 100 is provided that is suited for
use in testing 10 GE, SONET, and FC networks and devices.
Of course, various other combinations of functionalities may
likewise be employed. This functionality is useful in cases
where, for example, metropolitan area networks (“MAN”)
employing multiple protocols must be tested.

In general, the exemplary network 200 in connection with
which various embodiments of the BERT 100 may be
employed includes first and second network devices 202 and
204. In some exemplary implementations, one or both of the
network devices 202 and 204 comprise a repeater, regen
erator, or other retiming device such as a Xenpak trans
ceiver. More generally however, the first and second net
work devices 202 and 204 may comprise any network
device in connection with which one or more implementa
tions of the BERT 100 may be employed.
In addition to first and second network devices 202 and
204, the network 200 further includes one or more network
nodes 206. In general, the network nodes 206 may comprise
any device, or combination of devices, that can return a test
bit sequence, discussed in further detail below, to the BERT
100. By way of example, the network node 206 may
comprise components such as, but not limited to, a router,
Switch or bridging device.
In the exemplary arrangement indicated in FIG. 1, the
BERT 100 is coupled into the network 200 so as to permit
testing of various network devices and/or data paths defined
by the network devices 202 and 204 and the network node
206. As described more fully below, the BERT 100 generates
and transmits a test bit sequence that, in this exemplary case,
travels through the first network device 202 and a second
network device 204. When the test bit sequence is received
back at the BERT 100, the test bit sequence is used by the
BERT 100 to determine the number of errors that occurred
on the indicated path.
Errors that corrupt or destroy certain portions of the
sequence can occur for a variety of reasons. For example,
optic signals typically experience some dispersion as they
interact with optical fiber. Such dispersion degrades the
signal, by lowering the signal-to-noise ratio, thereby causing
errors in the signal ultimately received. As another example,
various network devices on the path can also cause errors to
occur within the bit sequence.
Aspects of Such errors can be used to facilitate various
diagnostic and remedial processes. For example, device
failures or malfunctions on the network can be identified by
examining the specific number of errors that have occurred
on a particular path on the network, and the problematic
network device(s) can be adjusted or replaced as required.
Further, the number and occurrence of Such errors can also
be used to identify, locate and resolve problematic connec
tions within the network 200.
II. General Structural Aspects of An Exemplary BERT
Implementation
The following general discussion is directed to various
structural aspects of an exemplary implementation of a
BERT. Such discussion is not intended to limit the scope of
the invention in any way however, and the physical, as well
as operational, aspects of implementations of BERT that are
disclosed herein are exemplary only and may be varied as
necessary to Suit the requirements of a particular application.
In general, the BERT 100 is a platform that is used to
verify lower layers of links, independent of upper data
communication protocols, at various line rates. Exemplary
line rates supported by the BERT 100 include, but are not
limited to, 9.95 Gigabit/second, 10.3 Gigabit/second, and
10.5 Gigabit/second. Further, the BERT 100 is also config
ured to Support pattern specification in a variety of upper
layer serial protocols for network BERT 100 testing.
With regard to aspects of its physical configuration, this
exemplary implementation of the BERT 100 is configured as
an externally powered stand-alone device that employs a
US 7,231,558 B2
7
300 pin MSA connector that allows the BERT 100 to
function as a modular site to connect to various types of
optical and/or electrical transceivers/transponders. Exem
plarily, the BERT 100 is controlled by software running at a
host under Windows 2000 or Windows NT 4.X and includes
an Ethernet, R232 serial, or Universal Serial Bus (“USB)
interface to the host. The host interface of the BERT 100
may alternatively comprise a parallel port.
Further physical aspects of this exemplary implementa
tion of the BERT 100 relate to the media in connection with
which the BERT 100 may be employed. For example, the
BERT 100 includes a modular media area that enables the
use of daughter cards containing different logic-to-network
media types. Among other things, this aspect of the BERT
100 permits the BERT 100 to be used in connection with a
variety of media types, thus enhancing the operational
flexibility of the BERT 100. The BERT 100 also includes a
secondary connector for use in carrying control signals to
logic present on one or more of the daughter boards. In at
least some implementations, this secondary connector
enables the reporting of the nature and type of the attached
media.
Directing particular attention now to FIG. 2, a block
diagram is illustrated that provides basic information con
cerning various connections and data paths within an exem
plary BERT 100 implementation. As suggested there,
embodiments of the BERT 100 may include multiple inter
faces, or ports, such as ports 102, 104,106 and 108, through
which data may be transmitted and/or received. Such ports
may be optical or electrical or, the BERT 100 may employ
a combination of optical and electrical ports.
Further, the ports 102, 104,106 and 108 may assume any
of a variety of different configurations, depending upon
factors such as, but not limited to, the intended function(s)
of the port. In one exemplary implementation of BERT 100,
port 102 comprises a 300 pin XBI interface, while the port
104 comprises, for example, a direct serial port, an electrical
serial interface, or a 10 Gigabit Small Form Factor Plug
gable (XFP) optical or electrical port. Further, the port 106
comprises, in Some exemplary implementations of BERT
100, a XENPAK port, or a 10 GE interface.
Finally, at least some implementations of BERT 100
provide for a port 108 that serves as a host connection that
allows the BERT 100 to be controlled by a host device. For
example, a host device running an operating system, Such as
the Windows(R 2000TM operating system (Windows and
Windows 2000 are trademarks of Microsoft Corporation of
Redmond, Wash.), may be used to control the operation of
the BERT 100 and/or to analyze data provided by the BERT
100. The port 108 may be configured as, for example,
Ethernet, serial RS232, Universal Serial Bus (“USB'), or as
a parallel port.
It should be noted that the types and combination of
interfaces described in connection with the exemplary
embodiment of BERT 100 illustrated in FIG. 2, as well as the
associated protocols, are exemplary only and are not
intended to limit the scope of the invention in any way. More
generally, any additional or alternative type and/or combi
nation of ports, conforming to any of a variety of protocols,
may be employed as necessary to Suit the requirements of a
particular application.
Among other things, the multiple ports 102, 104,106 and
108, and/or other interfaces, lend significant flexibility to
implementations of the BERT 100 in that they permit the
BERT 100 to operate in a multiple mode configuration. For
example, some implementations of the BERT 100 are con
figured with a combination of ports that enable the BERT
10
15
25
30
35
40
45
50

100 to operate in a dual mode, such as an optical/electrical
mode. In one such exemplary implementation, operations of
the BERT 100 include transmitting a test bit sequence from
a fiber optic port, Such as a mixed block input output
(“XBI) port for example, and receiving the return test bit
sequence on an electrical port such as, for example, a direct
SubMiniature version A (“SMA') port. Thus, embodiments
of the BERT 100 are configured to be readily employed in
a variety of different types of networks, and can be placed in
any number and type of different data paths within a given
network.
Various other types of operational flexibility are likewise
afforded by interfaces such as the exemplary ports 102, 104,
106 and 108. By way of example, an XBI interface and
direct serial port, such as an SMA port, allow traffic trans
mitted by the BERT 100 to be looped through a cable, either
with or without attenuation, in order to enable testing, at the
ports 102 and 104, respectively, of the transmit (TX) and
receive (RX) side integrities of the XBI module, optical
fiber, or other physical layer device.
Further, where port 106 is implemented for use in con
nection with a XENPAK module, port 106 enables traffic to
be transmitted by the BERT 100 to a XENPAK module
through an X Ethernet Attachment Unit Interface (XAUI)
interface and then looped to the serial interface of the
XENPAK module in order to test the integrity of the
XENPAK module, or the integrity of any other device
attached to the XENPAK module. With respect to the
foregoing, the XAUI port exemplarily defines a narrow, fast
GE data pipe that is implemented with integrated circuitry
Such as complementary metal oxide semiconductor
(“CMOS) integrated circuits, or embedded application spe
cific integrated circuits (ASIC).
In addition to the general operational flexibility that they
afford, interfaces such as exemplary ports 102, 104,106 and
108 also enable a relatively high level of flexibility in terms
of the creation and detection of the sequence bits that
comprise the test bit sequences employed by embodiments
of the BERT 100. For example, the test bit stream created by
the BERT 100 and transmitted from the XBI and direct serial
ports may comprise, among other things, a user-defined bit
sequence or a pseudo-random bit sequence (“PRBS”). In
similar fashion, the bit stream created by the BERT 100 and
transmitted from an XAUI port exemplarily comprises 10
GE traffic, which may include user-defined patterns of idles,
frames and words.
As briefly described above, and as further suggested in
FIG. 2, the ports 102, 104, 106 and 108 are configured and
arranged to interact with various components within the
BERT 100 so as to enable implementation of various func
tionalities. Exemplarily, a bus 110 connects each of the ports
102,104,106 and 108 and allows data to travel between and
among the various components of the BERT 100.
In the illustrated implementation, the BERT 100 further
includes a memory device 112, a comparator 114, and
control logic module 116, all of which are connected by way
of the bus 110. Exemplarily, the memory device 112
includes two internal RAMs, a Send RAM and a Com
pare RAM that, respectively, define the test bit sequence
that will be sent, and the bit sequence that will be compared
to the received bit sequence. Further details concerning
aspects of the structure and operation of exemplary imple
mentations of the memory device 112 are provided below.
The comparator 114 of the BERT 100 comprises digital
logic that enables comparison of the received test bit
sequence to a copy of the test bit sequence that was
transmitted initially from the BERT 100. In general, the
US 7,231,558 B2
comparator 114 identifies errors within the received bit
sequence and calculates a bit error rate.
The control logic module 116 is coupled to the ports 102,
104, 106 and 108, by way of bus 110, and generally serves
to control activities at those ports, and also implements
various control functionalities concerning other components
within the BERT 100. The functionality represented by
control logic 116 may be implemented with any suitable
digital circuitry. In at least Some implementations, the con
trol logic 116 is configured to be modified to accommodate
the requirements of a particular application. By way of
example, Some implementations of the control logic 116
include suitable field programmable gate arrays (“FPGA)
that enable the circuit logic to be readily upgraded to
accommodate changes to operational parameters, examples
of which include protocol modifications and line rate
changes.

IV. General Operational Aspects of An Exemplary BERT
Implementation
The following general discussion is directed to various
operational aspects of an exemplary implementation of a
BERT. Such discussion is not intended to limit the scope of
the invention in any way however, and the operational, as
well as physical, aspects of implementations of the BERT
that are disclosed herein are exemplary only and may be
varied as necessary to Suit the requirements of a particular
application or situation. Moreover, while the disclosure
herein refers to various functionalities implemented by way
of the BERT, it should be understood that the functionalities
disclosed herein may be implemented by the BERT and/or
by the BERT control software. The particular allocation of
such functionalities between the BERT and such software
may be implemented as necessary to Suit the requirements of
a particular application.
In general, implementations of the BERT 100 are config
ured to implement testing of the integrity and other aspects
of network data paths and network devices. Exemplary
implementations of the BERT 100 operate in connection
with various networks and network devices that conform to
both synchronous and asynchronous protocols such as, but
not limited to, GE, 10 GE, FDDI, FC and 10 GFC, SONET
and 10 G SONET, and x4 InfiniBand. Examples of such
networks include, but are not limited to, WANs, LANs and
SANS.
While at least some implementations of the BERT 100 are
configured to both send and receive test bit sequences, such
implementations are port-selectable so that the BERT 100
may be employed only for transmission, or only for recep
tion/comparison of test bit sequences. With respect to the use
of the BERT 100 solely for reception/comparison of test bit
sequences, such functionality may be employed, for
example, where a separate device is generating and trans
mitting the test bit sequence. In the transmit-only configu
ration, the user can perform all signal characterization
without comparing the received test bit sequence with the
reference test bit sequence.
The foregoing arrangement is exemplary only however
and, more generally, embodiments of the BERT 100 may be
configured and/or employed in any of a variety of different
ways that make use of only selected aspects, or all, of the
functionality of the BERT 100. Thus, one aspect of imple
mentations of the BERT 100 is that they are well suited to
be employed in a variety of different configurations and can
be used in any number of different situations.
A. Aspects of the Generation and Use of Exemplary
BERT Test Bit Sequences
As Suggested above, an aspect of implementations of the
BERT 100 is that the BERT 100 is configured to create,
transmit and receive test bit sequences that can then be used
to detect and evaluate errors, as well as to generate error
rates, and to facilitate implementation of various remedial or
other actions. Various types of test bit sequences are
employed in this regard. For example, Some implementa
tions of the BERT 100 are configured to employ pseudo
US 7,231,558 B2
11
random bit sequences (“PRBS) as test bit sequences. In
other implementations, the BERT 100 is configured to
permit the use of user-defined test bit sequences, including
bit sequences that represent legal traffic for protocols such as
10 GE and 10 GFC. Still other implementations of the BERT
100 are configured to support both these, and other, types of
test bit sequences. The scope of the invention should not,
however, be construed to be limited to any particular type of
test bit sequence, or combination of test bit sequences.
In connection with the foregoing, the BERT 100 enables
customization of various aspects of user-defined, and other,
bit sequences. For example, for each entry on a user-defined
pattern word of 64 or 66 bits, the BERT 100 enables the user
to specify assertion of a trigger pulse.
As another example, a user defined pattern typically
includes a start word or start word combination that,
when detected by the BERT 100, starts the “compare
operation where the BERT 100 compares the received test
bit pattern with the transmitted test bit pattern. In addition to
the start word combination, a user defined test bit pattern
typically also includes a “end word or end word combina
tion that, when detected by the BERT 100, is used to
terminate the compare operation. Typically, the start and
stop criteria are defined at the 10 gigabit medium inde
pendent interface (XGMII')/media access control
(“MAC) or 16 bit word level, based upon the applied
module.
Among other things, the customization of a test bit pattern
to include a start word combination and an end word
combination enables a user to compare only selected por
tions of a test bit pattern, while skipping other portions. The
skipped portion typically includes sections of idles or other
fill words; this allows the BERT 100 to remain synchronized
with the bit stream in the presence of network devices that
add or drop fill words.
Another useful aspect pertaining to the use of the start
and stop criteria in user-defined test bit patterns relates to
the situation where corrupted bits occur in the data stream.
In particular, where corrupted bits are encountered, the
BERT 100 will count the number of corrupted bits and can
thus provide on-the-fly calculation of the associated bit error
rate (“BER). In the event that a clock malfunction or other
problem causes a bit to disappear, a phenomenon sometimes
referred to as “bit slip, the comparator of a BERT may,
absent the use of start and stop criteria, continuously
report errors, since all of the received data is shifted 1 bit.
However, the comparator of the BERT 100 readily prevents
this from occurring by using the start and stop criteria, in
connection with valid idles and fill words, to resynchronize
to the bit stream at each start word. This limits the length
of time a slipped bitstream is compared, and thus prevents
the measured error rate from becoming artificially high.
Exemplary implementations of the BERT 100 also facili
tate customization of test bit sequences by enabling the
insertion of placeholders in user-defined test bit sequences.
Exemplarily, the placeholders are replaced in real time, by
the BERT 100, with any of a variety of words or values,
examples of which include, but are not limited to, random
(“PRBS) words, incrementing words, incrementing bytes,
walking ones, walking Zeros, all ones, and all Zeros.
In connection with the foregoing, the BERT 100 also
enables a user to inject user-defined bit error rates, as well
as enabling the user to inject single bit errors. Thus, testing
procedures implemented by way of the BERT 100 can be
readily customized to Suit the requirements of a particular
application or situation.

Further, even where the transmitted bit sequence is pri
marily not user-defined, such as in the case of a PRBS, the
BERT 100 nonetheless enables a certain degree of customi
zation. For example, some implementations of the BERT
100 provide for the specification of a variety of PRBS line
balance options, wherein the line balance can be altered at
various predefined intervals Thus, in one exemplary imple
mentation; the BERT 100 provides the following line bal
ance options: PRBS with no line balance adjustments: 72
zeros injected every 10 bits; 72 ones injected every 10 bits:
72 zeros injected every 10 bits; 72 ones injected every 10°
bits; 72 Zeros injected every 10' bits; and, 72 ones injected
every 10' bits. Moreover, the length of the PRBS can
likewise be defined as desired. Some PRBS lengths sup
ported by exemplary implementations of the BERT 100
include PRBS 2-1, PRBS 2-1, PRBS 25-1, and PRBS
27-1.
B. Aspects of Exemplary BERT Transmission/Reception
Operations
Not only are aspects such as the form and content of test
bit sequences readily customizable, but aspects of the trans
mission of Such test bit sequences can likewise be user
specified to Suit operational or other requirements. For
example, implementations of the BERT 100 enable a user to
specify that a test bit sequence will be transmitted continu
ously by the BERT 100. The BERT 100 additionally, or
alternatively, enables a user to transmit a test bit sequence a
user-specified number of times. In other cases, a user can
specify that no bit sequence be transmitted and that an
alternative operation be performed. Examples of such alter
native operations performed by the BERT 100 include
sending one or more media-type and protocol-specific
words, or sending nothing, as would occur when the optical
transmitter, Such as a laser, has been inactivated.
While control of the operations of the BERT 100 is
achieved at least in part through the use of user-customizable
test bit sequences, the control of aspects of the operations of
the BERT 100 may be achieved in other ways as well. For
example, operations of the BERT 100 can be commenced or
terminated through the use of start and stop control options
implemented within the BERT 100. In particular, exemplary
implementations of the BERT 100 provide a bit to assert to
start operation of the BERT 100, and also provide a bit to
clear to stop operation of the BERT 100.
As suggested elsewhere herein, embodiments of the
BERT 100 can be used to generate and transmit test bit
sequences in connection with a wide variety of networks and
devices conforming to various protocols. With respect to
Such networks and devices, it is often the case that the clock
rate differs from one device to the next, within a particular
network. Consequently, such devices, as well as network
nodes in some instances, are typically configured to insert
idles or fill words within a received bit sequence in order to
compensate for such clock rate differentials. While the
presence of such idles or fill words alters the bit sequence,
exemplary implementations of the BERT 100 are nonethe
less capable of detecting the presence of such idles or fill
words within the bit sequence. This capability has various
implications with respect to the operation of and results
obtained by, the BERT 100.
For example, because the BERT 100 can detect the
presence of such idles and fill words within the bit sequence,
the BERT 100 is able to skip over those idles and fill words
when performing an error detection analysis. In some exem
plary implementations, the BERT 100 simply removes the
idle words from the sequence before performing an error
detection analysis. Further, the ability of the BERT 100 to
US 7,231,558 B2
13
detect idles and fill words within the bit sequence enables the
BERT 100 to readily determine when a received bit
sequence is unsynchronized and, moreover, to resynchronize
the identified unsynchronized sequence. Accordingly, even
if a bit sequence received at the BERT 100 is unsynchro
nized for some reason, the BERT 100 is nonetheless able to
resynchronize the received sequence and then make an error
determination as to the resynchronized sequence.
Moreover, such functionality is not limited in terms of the
protocols in connection with which it may be employed.
More generally, the operational aspects of the BERT 100
may be implemented as necessary to Suit the requirements of
a particular protocol, or group of protocols.
With particular reference to the 10 GE protocol, for
example, the BERT 100 uses a resynchronization technique,
discussed in further detail below, that enables error detection
and bit error rate calculation in connection with 10 GE
networks. Generally, Such resynchronization functionality is
implemented automatically and enables, among other
things, selective comparison of data packets for purposes of
bit error rate testing. In the 10 GE context, for example, the
BERT 100 compares respective payload data of the trans
mitted test bit sequence and received test bit sequence, but
ignores the idle and fill words between data packets.
Among other things, this selective comparison function
ality contributes to improved reliability of error detection
and error rate calculation by eliminating consideration of
extraneous changes to the data stream. As noted earlier, one
way to implement Such selective comparison functionality is
through the use of a start word combination and end word
combination.
C. Aspects of Exemplary BERT Data Capture Operations
In addition to controlling aspects such as the form,
content, and transmission and reception of test bit
sequences, implementations of the BERT 100 also enable
the capture and storage of information concerning the occur
rence of a particular triggering event during bit error mea
surements. In general, the BERT 100 provides for an exem
plary capture size of 1024 KB, and permits the specification
of what will be captured. For example, a user can specify
that all traffic be captured or, alternatively, that only mis
compared words be captured. In at least Some implementa
tions of the BERT 100, the user has the further option to
specify the post/pre-trigger location as a percentage of the
capture size.
A variety of other options are provided as well with
respect to the control of the traffic capture functionality of
the BERT 100. For example, implementations of the BERT
100 are configured to stop traffic capture according to
various criteria. Exemplary options include, but are not
limited to: Stopping capture immediately (such as upon
pressing a stop button); stopping upon a particular word,
with trigger-out option; stopping upon a miscompare, with
trigger-out option; stopping upon reaching a selected BER
threshold; stopping upon trigger-in; and, stopping upon loss
of synchronization of the data stream, with trigger-out
option. For the trigger output, the BERT 100 includes the
following options: do nothing; pulse once per detected
mismatch; and, pulse once per user-defined pattern option.
In at least some implementations, the BERT 100 further
enables a postfill operation that permits specification of a
predetermined number of words to be captured after the
traffic capture has been stopped.
With respect to the situation where capture is stopped
upon reaching a selected BER level, various further options
are included. In particular, exemplary choices for a BER
threshold include, but are not limited to: capturing all traffic
10

14
until selection of the 'stop button; 10 bit errors/second;
10 bit errors/second; and, 10 bit errors/second. Of course,
various other BER thresholds may likewise be defined and
implemented.
In addition to the various functionalities concerning the
creation, transmission, reception and capture of bit
sequences, exemplary implementations of the BERT 100
also include registers configured to report various types of
status information concerning BERT 100 operations. Exem
plary unit statuses provided by implementations of the
BERT 100 include, but are not limited to: state machine
state; configuration clock rate; configuration protocol; wire
status; ID of currently allocated card (or editor only if
running in editor only mode); send status; compare
status; elapsed time: BER: number of bits sent; number of
bits compared; time since last error, run status; current date;
current time; transceiver status bits; and, resynchronization
occurred.
D. Aspects of Exemplary BERT Status Reporting Opera
tions
The BERT 100 is also configured to report status infor
mation concerning specific BERT 100 components. For
example, when the XBI port is in use, the BERT 100
provides the following exemplary status information: mod
ule held in reset (True/False); laser (optical transmitter)
enabled (True/False); receive reference clock at either 161
MHz or 644 MHz; transmit reference clock at either 161
MHZ or 64.4 MHZ.
Status information concerning specific BERT 100 opera
tions is also provided. For example, with respect to transmit
operations, exemplary implementations of the BERT 100
provide the following transmit statuses: send state
machine status; elapsed time; sent bits. Likewise, exemplary
implementations of the BERT 100 provide various receive
statuses based upon the media type and/or protocol selected.
Such receive statuses include: bit error rate (“BER):
received bits, bytes, words, and loops; compared bits, bytes,
words, and loops; mismatched bits, bytes, words, and loops;
received bits since last error; received loops since last loop
with at least one error; and, elapsed time since last error. Of
course, various other receive statuses, as well as transmit
statuses may likewise be defined and reported, and the
foregoing exemplary statuses should not be construed to
limit the scope of the invention in any way. In the event that
the BERT 100 is configured for transmit only operation, the
receive statuses simply report “N/A. In connection with
the foregoing discussion, it should be noted that loop
transmission generally refers to the situation where the same
bit sequence is repeatedly transmitted by the BERT.
In addition to the foregoing, exemplary implementations
of the BERT 100 also provide information concerning signal
and operating statuses. For example, a pictogram and/or
LED are provided that report the status of the input optical
or electrical signal. In particular, a black or extinguished
LED represents a no signal or no hardware condition,
while a white or illuminated LED represents a signal
detected status. As to operating status, a pictogram and/or
LED are provided that report various states as follows:
(Green) data stream synchronized, no errors detected;
(Flashing Orange) mismatch detected, flash for 5 seconds
when bit error reported, reset counter every time mismatch
is reported; (Orange) mismatch detected, follows Flashing
Orange LED in absence of loss of synchronization; (Orange)
loss of synchronization detected, or returns to Flashing
Orange when mismatch detected; and, (Transparent) BERT
not operational or not connected to hardware. Note that the
US 7,231,558 B2
15
foregoing status schemes are exemplary only, and various
other schemes may alternatively be devised and imple
mented.
E. Aspects of Exemplary BERT Persistence/Logging
Operations
In order to promote the efficient use and operation of the
BERT 100, various persistence options are implemented that
allow ready re-use or recreation of various aspects of the
BERT 100 test bit sequences and operations. Some examples
of Such persistence options include: reset custom configu
ration to default; load a protocol-specific hardware configu
ration file upon exchange of protocol; save the last used
protocol upon application (software) exit; upon bootup, load
a hardware configuration file specific to the last used pro
tocol; save the last used clock rate upon application (soft
ware) exit; upon bootup, set hardware to digital passthrough
at the last used clock rate; save test scripts (test bit
sequences) via configuration files; Support all previous con
figuration files; and, provide instrument persistence. Addi
tional, or alternative, persistence options make likewise be
defined and implemented consistent with the requirements
of a particular application.
Exemplary implementations of the BERT 100 provide for
a variety of logging options concerning BERT 100 opera
tions. For example, at least Some implementations provide
for the following logging operations: create optional log file
to disk; provide default log filename and allow optional user
specified filename; provide user-modifiable default value (in
seconds) for interval update time between readings, where
the interval update time is, exemplarily, selected from a
range of 1 to 1000; provide a default value for the number
of readings to be stored in a circular memory buffer, selected
from an exemplary range of 1 to 10000; permit saving of
statistics gathered in connection with various BERT com
ponents and operations.
As Suggested by the foregoing, various types of logs may
be defined and employed in connection with embodiments
of the invention. In one exemplary implementation, a log is
generated that describes a triggering event, discussed in
detail elsewhere herein, and associated resynchronization,
so that a user can analyze each event. This feature allows a
user to test the integrity of a data path over a relatively long
period of time in order to obtain a relatively more accurate
measurement of a corresponding BER.
With regard to the log files, templates or other structure
can be employed that ensure that certain basic information
is included in each log file created and/or modified. For
example, each log file may be configured to include: time/
date of the start of the BERT testing evolution; protocol and
clock rate of the BERT testing evolution; ID of the BERT
unit running the test: BERT results; and, time/date of the end
of the BERT testing evolution.
V. Aspects of Exemplary Send, Compare and Capture
RAMs
As noted earlier, one aspect of exemplary implementa
tions of the BERT is that the BERT exemplarily includes two
internal RAMs, specifically, a Send RAM and a Compare
RAM that, respectively, define the test bit sequence that will
be sent, and compare the received test bit sequence to the
transmitted test bit sequence. As a general discussion of
certain basic aspects of an exemplary BERT implementation
and associated functionality is facilitated somewhat through
particular reference to aspects of Such functionality as are
implemented by way of the RAMs, consideration will first
be given to a brief discussion of various aspects of exem
plary RAM implementations.

A. Basic RAM Functional Aspects
Exemplarily, the RAMs are each configured to hold data
words up to 66-bits wide, as well as holding various control
bits. In most implementations, the Send RAM and Com
pare RAM are loaded with identical data, meaning that the
bit sequence that is received will be compared to a bit
sequence identical to that sent. Further, the control bits
contained in the RAMs are configured to implement a
variety of functions, examples of which include inserting
automatic placeholders in a bit sequence, inserting an auto
matically generated cyclical redundancy check (“CRC) in
a bit sequence, and Supplying control codes for each data
byte in XGMII mode. As disclosed elsewhere herein, the
placeholder function inserts a dynamically-calculated word
into the data stream. Exemplary placeholder types include,
among others, PRBS (with four programmable polynomi
als), incrementing words/bytes, walking ones/Zeros, and all
ones/Zeros. The CRC function calculates the CRC over a
user-defined portion of the data and inserts the calculated
value into the data stream.
Generally, the Compare RAM enables allows the test bit
sequence transmitted from the Send RAM to be regener
ated on the receive side of the BERT, using a receive clock
that may be asynchronous with the send clock. The regen
erated test bit sequence can then be compared with the
transmitted test bit sequence, as described elsewhere herein.
B. RAM Send Modes
Exemplary implementations of the BERT 300 are config
ured to transmit bit sequences in various modes, examples of
which include raw 64-bit, raw 66-bit, XGMII, and continu
ous PRBS. The first three of the aforementioned modes send
a bit sequence that resides in the "Send RAM while, when
the BERT300 is in the PRBS mode, the BERT300 sends the
output of a PRBS generator, which is typically configured to
update every word. More particularly, the continuous PRBS
mode is implemented by way a Sub-mode that permits a
single word from the memory to be sent continuously. The
effect achieved by setting up this single word as a PRBS
placeholder is the continuous transmission of the output of
a PRBS generator.
In the raw 64-bit mode, 64-bit data words in the Send
RAM are sent as is. One 64-bit word is sent per transmit
clock. The raw 66-bit mode is similar, except that 66-bit
words are defined, and internal gearbox (rate-changing)
logic converts the 66-bit words to 64-bit output words. In
particular, thirty two (32) 66-bit words are output every 33
transmit clocks (66*32=64*33). Among other things, this
mode is useful for emulating a normal 10 GE data path,
which outputs 66 bit words (2 synchronization bits +64 data
bits), but enables full control over the bits sent. In both the
64-bit and 66-bit raw modes, the user must ensure that the
data sent is DC balanced and includes sufficient transitions
for reliable transmission onto the network.
As used herein, a DC balanced data stream refers to a
data stream containing an approximately equal number of 1
and 0 bits over a predetermined period of time. With respect
to transitions in the data stream, Such transitions generally
refer to a change from a 1 to a 0 or a 0 to a 1 in the data
stream. In the case of 10 GE devices and networks, for
example, Such a transition occurs at least once every 66 bits.
In at least some implementations, the host Software is
configured to present, by way of the GUI, information
concerning the DC balance of and number of transitions in,
a particular data stream. The host Software also generates
appropriate warnings, such as when a particular DC imbal
ance is noted and/or when the number of transitions falls
below a minimum acceptable level.
US 7,231,558 B2
17
In XGMII mode, the data in the Send RAM bears no
resemblance to the bits transmitted to the network. This is
due to the presence of block encoder and scrambler modules
in the data path. These modules implement the 64/66 b
coding standard specified for the 10 GE protocol. There is
also no requirement for DC balance or transition density in
the input XGMII codes.
In the XGMII mode, the user is able to define each output
word as a block of eight XGMII codes, where each code is
8 data bits +1 control bit. Internal BERT logic encodes each
block of 8 codes into a 66-bit frame, as defined by the 10 GE
standard. A 66-bit frame consists of 2 synchronization bits
+64 data bits. A scrambler is then applied to the data portion
of the frame to create transitions and DC balance. The 66-bit
frames are then converted back to 64 bits by a gearbox, as
described above, and transmitted onto the network. As in the
case of the raw 66-bit mode, thirty two (32) 66-bit words
sent every 33 transmit clocks.
C. RAM Compare Modes
In raw 64-bit, raw 66-bit and continuous PRBS modes,
the raw bits received are compared to the raw bits sent. For
raw-64 and raw-66 bit modes, a start word is used to
synchronize the pattern on the compare side. PRBS mode is
self-synchronizing, in that the current bits received deter
mine the expected subsequent bit sequence. In the XGMII
mode, on the other hand, data can be compared either at the
raw bit or decoded (XGMII) level. In the raw compare
mode, received bits are compared to the raw bits sent, that
is, the XGMII data after encoding and scrambling. In
decoded compare mode, the XGMII data decoded from the
received bits is compared to the original XGMII data defined
in the script. Note that as used herein, 'script means, and
may also be referred to as, user patterns or bit sequences.
Generally, the XGMII raw bit compare mode, as well as
the raw 64-bit, 66-bit, and PRBS modes, are best suited for
use with analog-passthrough type devices which return a
bit-for-bit copy of the data sent. Network devices that
perform retiming, add or drop idles, or otherwise affect the
data stream can also be tested in the XGMII raw bit compare
mode, but impose certain additional requirements, as dis
cussed below. Because Such devices typically employ inter
nal Scramblers that are not synchronized to the transmit
scrambler of the BERT, the actual bit sequence returned to
the BERT will be substantially different from the transmitted
bit sequence, even though the XGMII data coded in the bit
stream remains the same. Thus, decoded compare mode is
well suited for these devices.
However, decoded compare mode does not compare the
actual bits received on the medium, so it cannot provide a
true bit error rate measurement, as does raw bit compare
mode. Where raw bit compare mode is used with retiming
devices (those that may add or drop fill words), the actual
bits received by the BERT cannot be compared to the actual
bits sent, but the bits received can be compared to the bits
that should be received (“expected” bits), once the BERT
has properly synchronized to the received bit sequence. This
synchronization is performed using the start and stop
criteria as discussed previously.
With respect to operation of the BERT in the XGMII raw
bit compare mode, there is no 1-to-1 correspondence
between an XGMII word and its scrambled data value, or
bits sent on the network, since the scrambled value depends
on the data that was previously transmitted and, in the case
of constant data, the number of words that were transmitted.
Accordingly, synchronization, or start criteria detection,
which in one specific case comprises start word detection,
is implemented at the decoded level. The received bits are
10
15
25
30
35
40
45
50
55
60
65
18
descrambled and decoded to yield the original XGMII data,
and this data is then compared with the XGMII start word.
When the start word is found, the raw, or scrambled, bits
that yielded the start word are used to seed an internal
compare scrambler.
Exemplarily, the internal compare scrambler is the last
stage of a compare datapath (FIG. 3A) that starts with the
original XGMII data in the “Compare RAM 306. This
original XGMII data passes through a block encoder 334
and then into the compare scrambler 336. Seeding the
compare scrambler 336 with the raw received data that
corresponds to known XGMII data, that is, the start word,
synchronizes the compare scrambler to the transmit
scrambler in whatever device is generating the data received
by the BERT. This transmit scrambler, often resides in the
particular network device being tested. The output of the
compare scrambler is then a bit-for-bit copy of the output
from the transmit Scrambler, and is used as the comparand
data for the raw received bits.
In the case of devices which perform only the equivalent
of analog passthrough, the aforementioned process and
method ensures a bit-for-bit comparison of the sent bits to
the received bits. In the case of devices such as retiming
devices however, the received bits are not the same as the
transmitted bits. In view of the fact that the device has
transmitted a known word, the start word, correctly how
ever, the expected bit sequence from that point until the next
traffic modification, such as the add/drop of an idle word, is
known and can thus be compared. In this respect then, the
actual bits on the medium can still be compared for retiming
devices, but not to the actual bits sent.
Where the BERT is set to test retiming devices, the BERT
will seed the compare scrambler at every start word
detection, since the traffic may have changed in the resyn
chronization Zone before the start word. If the BERT is set
to test non-retiming devices, the BERT will seed the com
pare scrambler only on the first start word. Since non
retiming devices cannot modify the network traffic, the
compare scrambler value at the first start word forms the
basis for the determination of all subsequent expected val
CS.
D. RAM Capture Modes
In general, the Capture RAM is a memory for capturing
received data based on particular pre-defined events. The
processing of such captured data by the BERT is described
elsewhere herein. Exemplarily, the Capture RAM consists
of 128-bit entities, where each such entity corresponds to a
single 64-bit or 66-bit received data word. In the case of the
raw 64-bit or raw 66-bit compare modes, discussed above,
the data words are the actual bits received at the BERT from
the network. In the XGMII modes however, the data words
can be either the actual bits received at the BERT from the
network, or the decoded data.
VI. General Aspects of Testing Processes. As Implemented
by an Exemplary BERT
With the foregoing discussion of exemplary Send,
Compare and Capture RAM configurations and opera
tions in view, attention is directed now to FIG. 3A where
details are provided concerning high-level components of an
exemplary implementation of a BERT. For reference pur
poses, renewed attention is directed to FIG. 2 as well, where
aspects of exemplary data paths and component connection
arrangements are illustrated.
Exemplarily, this implementation of the BERT provides
error rate measurement, at bit granularity, on data paths that
include data altering components such as encoders and
US 7,231,558 B2
19
scramblers. Thus, this exemplary embodiment of the BERT
is well-suited for use in connection with high-speed net
works, such as those operating at line rates of about 10Gbps
or higher, using protocol specific traffic.
The implementation of the BERT is designated generally
at 300 in FIG. 3A, and defines transmit and receive
datapaths through which the BERT 300 communicates with
the network 200, and further defines an internal compare
datapath that facilitates implementation of various error rate
operations by the BERT 300. Generally, the transmit and
receive data paths are cooperatively defined by the BERT
300, a multiplexer/demultiplexer 300A and a media inter
face 300B configured to electrically or optically connect the
BERT 300 with the network 200 (FIG. 2). Exemplarily, the
multiplexer/demultiplexer 300A comprises a 16/64 multi
plexer/demultiplexer, while the media interface 300B com
prises a 300 pin XBI connector. Other implementations of
the multiplexer/demultiplexer 300A and/or media interface
300B may alternatively be employed however.
The send and receive datapaths, as well as the com
pare datapath, all pass through, or otherwise communicate
with a non-random sequence generator 302 that configured
to generate and transmit various bit sequences. In particular,
some of such bit sequences are defined in the Send RAM
304 and, as disclosed elsewhere herein, are transmitted onto
the network 200 (FIG. 1) by way of the transmit datapath
and are then received back at the BERT 300, by way of the
receive datapath, for analysis. Yet other bit sequences are
defined in the Compare RAM 306 and are transmitted
along the compare datapath so as to enable analysis of the
bit sequence defined in the Send RAM and received back
from the network 200 on the receive datapath. Both the
Send RAM 304 and the “Compare RAM 306 communi
cate with a control logic module 308 that, as disclosed
elsewhere herein, provides various control functionalities
concerning BERT 300 operations. Exemplarily, the Send
and Compare RAMs are implemented as 2Kx128 RAMs.
With more particular reference now to the transmit path,
bit sequences to be transmitted onto the network may be
generated in various ways. Generally, and as discussed
elsewhere herein, two types of bit sequences may be
employed. In some implementations bit sequences are
defined by a user and stored for Subsequent transmission.
Such user-defined bit sequences may include dynamic
aspects, such as placeholders. In addition to user-defined bit
sequences, yet other bit sequences are generated randomly,
Such as by a PRBS generator. Thus, bit sequence generation
may occur at, for example, a random sequence generator
Such as a PRBS generator, or at non-random sequence
generator 302, each of which may be more generally
referred to herein as a sequence generator.
Note that while the non-random sequence generator 302
facilitates regeneration of PRBS sequences that have been
transmitted onto the network, such regeneration is for com
parison purposes only. Accordingly, Such regenerated
sequences are not considered to be randomly generated bit
sequences, notwithstanding that the regenerated sequence
reflects a PRBS or other random sequence that was initially
generated to be transmitted onto the network to enable
testing.
In one exemplary implementation, the output side of the
Send RAM 304 serves as a part of the transmit path along
which a predefined bit sequence from the Send RAM 304
is transmitted. In this implementation, the transmitted bit
sequence passes unchanged through a placeholder/PRBS
generator 310 located downstream of the Send RAM 304
and that, as disclosed elsewhere herein, is capable of gen
10
15
25
30
35
40
45
50
55
60
65
20
erating random bit sequences and other types of bit and word
sequences. In connection with the foregoing arrangement
where the bit sequence is unchanged as it passes through the
placeholder/PRBS generator 310, it should be noted that,
more generally, any or all of the modules in the datapath can
be bypassed, so that, for example, if the user is not using
random bit sequences or placeholders, the control logic
module 308 will command the placeholder/PRBS generator
310 to simply pass through the data at its input to its output.
In an alternative implementation, the Send RAM 304,
guided by the control logic module 305, transmits instruc
tions to the placeholder/PRBS generator 310 that causes the
placeholder/PRBS generator 310 to generate a bit sequence.
In this implementation then, no bit sequence is transmitted
from the Send RAM 304. Thus, the output side of the
Send RAM 304 in this implementation functions as a
control signal path and not a data path. In either implemen
tation, the relevant operations are implemented in response
to control signals transmitted by the control logic module
305 over a suitable control bus (FIG. 4).
In any case, once the bit sequence passes through the
placeholder/PRBS generator 310, the bit sequence is then
transmitted to a CRC checksum module 312 that checks and
inserts a CRC value into the bit sequence prior to further
transmission of the bit sequence. After processing by the
CRC checksum module 312, the bit sequence is then
encoded and scrambled by encoder 314 and scrambler 316,
respectively. Exemplarily, the encoder 314 is implemented
as a 64/66 block encoder. Such encoding and Scrambling is
only performed however, if the BERT is transmitting in
XGMII mode. If the BERT is transmitting in raw 64-bit or
raw 66-bit mode, no encoding or scrambling is performed.
The bit sequence is then converted, by gearbox 318, exem
plarily implemented as a 66/64 gearbox/error injector, back
into a form suitable for transmission onto the network. This
operation is only necessary if the BERT is transmitting in a
mode that uses 66 bits per word, such as raw 66-bit or
XGMII. If necessary, the bit sequence is multiplexed by the
multiplexer/demultiplexer 300A before transmission onto
the network through the media interface 300B.
After the bit sequence has traveled through the network
200, it returns through the media interface 300B and is
demultiplexed, if necessary, by the multiplexer/demulti
plexer 300A before returning to the BERT300. The returned
bit sequence is then bit aligned by a gearbox/bit shifter 320
operating in cooperation with a bit aligner 322. Exemplarily,
the gearbox/bit shifter 320 is implemented as a 64/66
gearbox/bit shifter. Note that the gearbox/bit shifter 320 and
the bit aligner 322 may be collectively referred to herein as
a bit synchronizer, and, similarly, the processes performed
by such components may be collectively referred to herein
as synchronization. It should likewise be noted that such
bit synchronization is distinct, and different, from the
start word synchronization disclosed elsewhere herein.
After the received bit sequence has been thus aligned, the bit
sequence is descrambled by descrambler 324, and then
decoded by a decoder 326 that communicates with the
control logic module 306. As suggested above, such decod
ing and descrambling is only required where the BERT 300
is operating in XGMII mode. A capture buffer 328, in
communication with the receive datapath, is also provided
that receives the bit sequence after the bit sequence has
passed through the gearbox/bit shifter 320.
Once the transmitted bit sequence has returned from the
network, the BERT 300 is then able to implement various
evaluation and analysis processes. In particular, the bit
sequence that is to be used for comparison with the returned
US 7,231,558 B2
21
bit sequence is either retrieved from the Compare RAM
306 or is regenerated by the random bit sequence regenera
tor 330, exemplarily implemented as a placeholder/PRBS
generator. In either case, control of these operations is
implemented by way of the control logic module 308 acting
through a suitable control bus (FIG. 4).
Once the comparison bit sequence has been retrieved, or
regenerated, as applicable, that bit sequence is then trans
mitted to a CRC checksum module 332 that regenerates the
same CRC that was transmitted. Next, the bit sequence is
encoded and scrambled by encoder 334, exemplarily imple
mented as a 64/66 block encoder, and scrambler 336,
respectively, and then placeholder/PRBS passed to the com
parator 338 for comparison with the returned bit sequence.
The comparator 338 then provides the comparison results to
a statistics and counters module 340.
As suggested by the foregoing discussion concerning
transmit and compare processes, such as in the 64-bit and
66-bit raw bit modes for example, various modules of the
BERT 300 may be bypassed in some instances. More
generally, the BERT300 allows the user to optionally bypass
any of the modules in the 64/66 datapath. As another
example, a user may optionally disable the encoder and
specify that the data be fed to the scrambler directly. Among
other things, such functionality allows the user to create
either legal traffic or arbitrary traffic with user-defined
protocol errors.
Moreover, implementations of the BERT enable the user
to select and implement, with a single BERT, various
operational modes. More particularly, the BERT enables the
user to select various protocol modes, such as where the
user specifies bit sequences at the XGMII level that conform
to the 10 GE/10 GFC protocols, raw bit modes such as the
64-bit and 66-bit modes, or a PRBS output mode. Such
flexibility is particularly useful in view of the multitude of
network types and protocols.
Another aspect of BERT implementations is their ability
to transmit user-defined bit sequences, that use the 64/66
coding datapath, while still enabling comparison of the data
at the raw bit level. In contrast, typical protocol-based "error
testing devices generally only compare the data after
decoding, and thus do not measure a true BER. Moreover,
known devices that do test at the bit level do not support
protocol traffic, only PRBS or raw data, which is not
understood by protocol-specific devices.
With reference now to FIG. 3B, and with continuing
reference to FIGS. 2 and 3A, more specific details are
provided concerning an exemplary bit error rate testing
method 400 implemented at bit granularity by the BERT
300. At state 402 of the process 400, the non-random
sequence generator 302 generates a bit sequence that will be
used in connection with various tests and diagnostics per
formed concerning operational and other aspects, such as
determination of a BER, of one or more network paths and
devices. Typically, the bit sequence is generated using
pre-stored data from the Send RAM, and transmits the
generated bit sequence, or test bit sequence or script, onto
the network. It should be noted that, in exemplary imple
mentations, the Send and Compare BRAMS are each
loaded with identical data. In some implementations, error
detection performed by the BERT involves a looping pro
cess where the same bit sequence or word pattern is trans
mitted on the data path repeatedly over a period of time. In
other cases however, Such as where 64:66 coding is
employed, the XGMII data is the same every loop, but the
bits transmitted on the medium differ from one loop to the
neXt.

In some implementations, a user assists in the creation of
bit sequences or patterns by way of a host attached to the
BERT, such as by way of port 108 (FIG. 2). In particular, a
graphical user interface (“GUI), implemented as a part of
Software resident on the host, enables a user to define, save,
and reuse bit sequences. As disclosed elsewhere herein,
various other persistence options are likewise made avail
able to the user through the software. Exemplary functions
implemented by the software, through user interaction with
the GUI, include word length selection, placeholder defini
tion, a specific packet/frame selector for jitter measure
ments, a copy/paste/cut option and a CRC control command.
Additionally, the GUI is configured to display various status
information, details of which are disclosed elsewhere herein,
Such as a count of mismatched bits, a count of mismatched
words, bit error rate calculation, elapsed time and total
number of compared bits, elapsed time and number of bits
since last error, and a count of the number of detected loops
with at least one error.
It was noted earlier herein that a user-defined bit sequence
such as are employed by exemplary BERT implementations
may include one or more placeholders that command the
insertion of a dynamically-generated data word into the bit
sequence. Depending on the type of placeholder, such data
words may be PRBS based random numbers, incrementing
words, incrementing bytes, walking ones and Zeros, all ones
and Zeros, or other types of dynamically generated data. By
way of example, the bit sequence or word pattern may be
defined at the XGMII level, a MAC interface for the 10 GE
Protocol, and placeholders may be inserted as XGMII data,
creating, for example, random frame payloads.
Alternatively, the placeholders may be sent as-is to create
a raw bit pattern. These defined placeholders may be filled
by the placeholder/PRBS generator 310 using random
words, incrementing words, incrementing bytes, walking
ones and Zeroes, or all ones or zeroes. Further, the BERT is
configured to employ automatic CRC insertion, Such as by
way of CRC checksum module 312. Generally, automatic
CRC insertion is useful whenever there is any placeholder in
the predefined data pattern, such as a random number for
example, since the data generated by that placeholder
changes every loop, even though the data in the memory
remains the same.
With continuing reference now to FIG. 3B, generation of
the test bit sequence causes the process 400 to advance to
states 404 and 406 where the encoder 314 and scrambler 316
of the BERT 300 encode and scramble, respectively, the test
bit sequence. In 10 GE applications, at least, such encoding
involves outputting thirty two (32) 66-bit words every 33
transmit clocks (66*32=64*33).
Exemplarily, such encoding is implemented by way of a
64:66 encoder that, for example, alters a first or initial bit
sequence B to the second bit sequence B'. The bit sequence
B' is transmitted to a scrambler 306 that alters the second bit
sequence B' to a third bit sequence B". This third bit
sequence B" is then transmitted onto a network data path, as
described below.
After the bit sequence has been thus encoded and
scrambled, the process 400 advances to state 408 where the
test bit sequence is transmitted along a data path defined by
various network devices and nodes, before ultimately return
ing, at state 410, to the BERT 300 through the receive port.
Exemplarily, the bit sequence returns to the BERT 100 as,
for example, a return bit sequence B". In the case of
non-retiming devices, the returned bit sequence should
match bit-to-bit to the third bit sequence B". For retiming
devices however, the BERT will use the portion of the
US 7,231,558 B2
23
received sequence B" that decodes to the start word to seed
the compare scrambler. The output of the compare datap
ath, to which the received data is compared, will then be
synchronized to received sequence B", which in general will
not be the same as sequence B". As discussed below
however, if errors occur within the return bit sequence B",
such errors may further alter the bit sequence as it travels
through components on the receive path. Note that the
foregoing, and following related discussion, only applies to
the decoded compare mode, since in raw bit compare
mode, the comparison occurs at the B" level indicated
above. As suggested by the foregoing, one useful aspect of
the raw compare mode is that there is no error multipli
cation. In particular, the output of the receive datapath
descrambler/decoder is only used to detect the start word.
With continuing reference now to FIG. 3B, descrambling
and decoding of the returned bit sequence by the BERT
causes the process 400 to advance to state 412 where the
received bit sequence, which may have been de-serialized or
de-multiplexed, is aligned by the gearbox/bit shifter 320 and
bit aligner 322. Generally, the gearbox/bit shifter 320 and bit
aligner 322 shift the bit sequence until the received bit
sequence has the same alignment as the transmitted
sequence. Among other things, such functionality allows the
BERT to operate on a relatively broader network scale and
provides realignment functionality in the event that the
returned test bit sequence is not synchronized when initially
received at the BERT.
It should be noted that the foregoing are exemplary
implementations of alignment functionalities and, accord
ingly, are not intended to limit the scope of the invention in
any way. More generally, any other arrangements effective
in implementing alignment functionality, or comparable
functionality, may likewise be employed. With more specific
reference to the alignment state, any lost or corrupted bits
within the received test bit sequence, or clocking errors in
the received test bit sequence, are detected, thereby allowing
the received test bit sequence to be realigned. In the XGMII
mode, the two sync bits used in 64/66 b coding are used to
perform alignment. In raw bit modes, start word detection
is used. In each mode, the gearbox/bit shifter 320 and bit
aligner 322 continuously shift the received datastream until
the alignment criteria is satisfied. In the XGMII mode,
satisfaction of the alignment criteria is indicated by several
consecutive valid sync bits, while satisfaction of the align
ment criteria in the raw modes is indicated by a start word
match. Note that the PRBS mode does not require alignment
of data sequences, as PRBS sequences are inherently self
synchronizing.
The process 400 next advances to states 414 and 416
where the BERT descrambles and decodes, respectively, the
return test bit sequence. As suggested earlier, the transit of
the return bit sequence B" through devices such as the
descrambler 324 and the decoder 326 tends to further
amplify an error or errors present within the return bit
sequence B". Specifically, the descrambling and decoding
of a return bit sequence B" that includes one or more errors,
may result in further errors being generated in the bit
sequence and may not provide the error bits sharply and
clearly to the comparator 338. It should be noted that, as
used herein, components such as a encoder, Scrambler,
descrambler, and decoder, refer to those components as
defined and described in connection with the 10 GE Proto
col.
In conventional testing systems and devices. Such addi
tional errors from descrambling and decoding would be
identified during an error detection measurement and may be
10

24
erroneously attributed to the network path that is being
tested. Accordingly, bit error calculations may not be per
formed using the first bit sequence B if bit error measure
ments of the true received bits at bit granularity are desired.
This problem is particularly significant in high data rate
networks where bit sequence altering components are used
within the BERT 300. As discussed in further detail below
however, embodiments of the BERT perform comparisons at
the raw bit level, and employ idle and filler word detection
that allows the BERT to overcome clock differences result
ing from clock conversions between network devices Such
as, for example, from an XAUI clock to a reference clock,
and corrupted or discarded bits within the returned bit
sequence that may cause loss of synchronization.
Exemplary implementations of the BERT and associated
processes provide for other functionality as well with respect
to the returned bit sequence. For example, at least some
implementations provide for a Snoop capability that pro
vides data relating to and/or Surrounding a detected error to
be stored and provided for later analysis. Among other
things, the Snoop aspect enables a bit granularity error
measurement on a bit sequence. In one embodiment, a copy
of the received bit sequence is stored within a Snoop buffer
328, exemplified as a FIFO buffer used to store and provide
data in the event an error is detected. Once an error is
detected by the comparator 338, a Snoop buffer control may
request that particular data within the snoop buffer 328 be
stored for later analysis of the detected error. Additionally,
control information may be stored to provide more infor
mation to a user for analysis.
Further, the Snooping capability also allows for relevant
data to be stored when a particular triggering event occurs
during bit error measurements. One example of a triggering
event is the occurrence of a bit miscomparison between the
third bit sequence B" and the return bit sequence B". A
triggering event may also be defined as the point where the
BER crosses a predefined threshold. Such triggering events
and thresholds may be integrated within the BERT 300 or,
alternatively, may be defined by a user.
Once a triggering event occurs, the return bit sequence
within the Snoop buffer 328 is stored for analysis. For
instance, all of the data stored within the snoop buffer 328
Surrounding an error bit is stored so that details relating to
the error can be readily analyzed. Further, details concerning
a resynchronization that results after occurrence of a trigger
condition may likewise be stored and Subsequently ana
lyzed. Also, information concerning multiple triggering
events and resynchronizations can be stored and evaluated.
In some instances, it is useful to present this information in
a graphical format, such as by plotting bit error counts
and/or BER as a function of time.
As disclosed elsewhere herein, other characteristics of
this Snoop and capture aspect may be defined by a user.
Thus, a capture may be defined to require storage of all
traffic within the Snoop buffer 328, storing only miscom
pared words, stopping capture upon a specific word with a
trigger-out option, stopping capture upon a miscompare with
trigger-out option, immediately stopping the error measure
ments, or stopping capture upon trigger-in.
Among other things, such Snoop and capture aspects, in
cooperation with bit error measurement at bit granularity,
enable the BERT to operate on various types of networks
having different data rates. Examples of Such networks
include, but are not limited to, high speed networks Such as
OC-192 or 10 GE networks.
After the received test bit sequence has been descrambled
and decoded, as required when the BERT 300 is in the
US 7,231,558 B2
25
XGMII raw bit mode for example, the process 400 advances
to state 418 where the aligned bit sequence is forwarded to
the control logic module 308. Among other things, the
control logic module 308 detects the presence of, and
identifies, start and end words in the returned test bit
sequence. Such start word and end word detection enables
the receiver to skip over idles and fill words which may have
been added to or dropped from the sequence by the device(s)
or network under test. This capability also ensures synchro
nization, at state 420, of the comparison of the received bit
sequence to a regenerated bit sequence, using the pre-stored
data in the memory. The ability of embodiments of the
invention to detect, and compensate for, such idles and fill
words makes Such embodiments particularly useful for
employment in connection with networks and devices where
idles and fill words are used, such as 10 GE networks,
systems and devices.
With more particular reference to the aforementioned
identification and detection processes, the control logic
module 308 is adapted to identify this start word of a word
pattern by identifying a defined value(s) for start words in a
bit sequence, either by identifying a pre-defined value(s) for
start words or receiving the start word from the non-random
sequence generator 302. The control logic module 308 may
also identify end words in the bit sequence so that BERT 300
knows when to terminate a comparison process.
By identifying the start of the returned test bit sequence,
the control logic module 308 enables the comparator 338 to
compare the received bit sequence to the sequence stored in
the compare RAM 306. In the case of a 10 GE implemen
tation for example, the 10 GE protocol has defined start
word patterns that the control logic module 308 uses to
identify in order to find a start word within a data stream.
Typically, although this is not required, the BERT start
word would include the corresponding protocol START
character, for example, the control character FB in XGMII.
since this character is likely to immediately follow an
idle/fill word section, and thus indicate the start of the data
to be compared. The end word, within the data stream, will
be identified so that idles are not included in the comparison.
Consequently, the bit sequence to compare within the 10 GE
data stream can be readily identified from start to end.
When the start word is identified, the comparator 338 is
enabled, and after the end word is identified, the compara
tor 338 is disabled. Thus, the comparison occurs only on bits
between a start word and an end word. That is, the data
between the start word and end word comprises the com
pare Zone, and the data outside this region is in the no
compare Zone. Among other things, this functionality
enables testing of networks and devices, notwithstanding
that Such networks and devices may add/drop idles and/or
fill words from the datastream.
After the received bit sequence has been synchronized for
comparison, the process 400 advances to state 422 where the
expected bit sequence is regenerated by the placeholder/
PRBS generator 330 based upon data in the “Compare RAM
306. The regenerated bit sequence is passed to CRC check
sum module 332 at state 424 for regeneration of the trans
mitted CRC, if enabled, and then encoded at state 426 and
scrambled at state 428, respectively, by encoder 334 and
scrambler 336. The output of this stage is the expected
data.
The control logic module 308 then activates the compara
tor 338 and the process 400 advances to state 430 where the
received data is compared with the expected data, regener
ated from data stored in the Compare RAM through the
process discussed above. In general, the comparator 338
10
15
25
30
35
40
45
50
55
60
65
26
compares the received bits with the regenerated data and, at
state 432, performs various analyses and other processes
which may include, among other things, collecting various
statistics such as single bit errors, bytes with errors, words
with errors, and bits received since last error.
Such analysis by the comparator 338 exemplarily occurs
bit-to-bit, thus enabling the comparator 338 to count the
number of errors within the received test bit sequence. At
state 434, the BER for the network path, or device(s), under
test is then determined based upon the number of errors
counted within the bit sequence. Specifically, the number of
errors is integrated over a period of time in order to identify
an average BER for the particular network path on which the
bit sequence traveled. In some implementations, the com
parison is momentarily disabled, or otherwise implemented
periodically, in order to improve the accuracy of the error
count. For example, if a received bit sequence is not syn
chronized, the comparator 338 may be deactivated in order
to prevent erroneous bit error rate calculations.
Information obtained by, and/or generated by, the com
parator 338 may be employed in a variety of useful ways.
Once the characteristics of the errors identified by the
comparator 338 are analyzed, various actions can be taken
with respect to devices on the path. For example, in order to
improve performance, repairs and/or adjustments may be
made to network devices such optical amplifiers and repeat
CS.
As another example, some implementations of the com
parator 338 are configured to transmit error counts to host
software that interprets the error counts and then performs,
or causes the performance of, one or more corresponding
actions. Thus, a BER of 10 bit errors/second, for example,
may define a threshold that, when reached, triggers genera
tion and transmission of an appropriate notice to a network
manager. As suggested by the foregoing, BER thresholds
may represent major problems within the network Such as a
failing device, or cut or damaged optical transmission fiber.
As another example, a relatively high BER may indicate a
loss of synchronization.
The foregoing uses of information obtained by, and/or
generated by, the comparator 338 are exemplary only and
are not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any
way. More generally, such information can be identified,
collected, retained, analyzed and/or used in any other way
that may prove useful in a particular application or operating
environment. As suggested elsewhere herein, at least some
implementations of the BERT are configured to perform
error rate counts at the word level, as well as at the bit level.
Among other things, such functionality enables the general
use of the BERT in networks, regardless of buffering, so
long as the data is not reordered. The following discussion
considers various aspects of one such BERT implementa
tion.
More particularly, Such functionality is exemplarily
implemented by way of a statistics and counter module
configured with the appropriate types and numbers of error
counters. In one exemplary implementation, the statistics
and counter module is configured so that every group of 66
bits comprises a word, and each bit within a given word is
checked for errors. When configured thus, the statistics and
counter module will increment both bit and word error
counters appropriately.
For example, a single bit error within a group of the 66
bits in a word implicates a word error as well as a bit error,
so that both the word error counter and the bit error counter
will increment by one if a single bit error is detected within
a 66 bit word sequence. As another example, 66 bit errors
US 7,231,558 B2
27
within a word will cause the bit error counter to increment
by 66 and the word error counter to increment by one, since
66 bit errors, within the same word, nonetheless correspond
to only a single word error. In the case where no bit errors
are detected within a 66 bit word, neither the bit error
counter nor the word error counter will increment.
As Suggested by the foregoing, both bit and word error
rate calculations can be performed within a single BERT.
Alternatively, other BERT implementations may be config
ured to calculate either word error rate calculations or bit
error rate calculations. Thus, the scope of the invention
should not be construed to be limited to any particular
implementation of the BERT.
VII. Specific Operational/Control Aspects of an Exemplary
BERT
As disclosed elsewhere herein, exemplary BERT com
mand and control operations are implemented and/or facili
tated by way of a control logic module operating in con
nection with a control bus and associated control and
feedback paths. Details will now be provided regarding
more specific aspects of data flow and related processing and
control components and operations in an exemplary embodi
ment of a BERT, generally designated at 500, that is suitable
for use in connection with networks and devices operating at
line rates as high as about 10 Gigabits/second or higher.
Note that, as details concerning some aspects of the structure
and operation of an exemplary control logic module, and
other BERT components, have been provided elsewhere
herein, the following discussion will focus primarily on
selected structural and operational aspects of the illustrated
embodiment of the BERT.
With particular attention now to FIG. 4, the exemplary
illustrated embodiment of the control logic module 502
comprises: a RAM address generator; a RAM parser; data
path control logic; synchronization and start word detec
tors; bit error counter control logic, bit sequence capture
control logic; and a host interface. Of course, various
additional or alternative components may likewise be
employed, consistent with the requirements of a particular
application or operating environment.
Among other things, the control logic module 502 of the
BERT 500 communicates with, and controls, various BERT
500 components by way of appropriate control buses. In the
illustrated embodiment, a transmit datapath control bus
504A is provided that generally enables the control logic
module 502 to control and/or monitor the operation of the
placeholder/PRBS generator 506, CRC checksum module
508, 64/66 block encoder 510, scrambler 512, and 66/64
gearbox/error injector 514 in the transmit datapath. Simi
larly, a compare datapath control bus 504B is also provided
within the BERT 500. Among other things, the compare
datapath control bus 504B generally enables the control
logic module 502 to control and/or monitor the operation of
the placeholder/PRBS generator 516, CRC checksum mod
ule 518, 64/66 block encoder 520, scrambler 522, and
comparator 524 in the compare datapath.
In addition to the transmit and compare datapath
control buses implemented and employed within the BERT
500, various other feedback and control structures and
functionalities are likewise employed by embodiments of
the BERT 500. For example, control signal paths 526 are
provided that enable the control logic module 502 to control
and direct the operation of the Send RAM 528 and the
Compare RAM 530.
With continuing reference to FIG. 4, it was noted earlier
herein that two synchronization bits, for 64:66 coding, are
10

25
30
35
40
45
50
55

28
employed in connection with embodiments of the invention
in order to facilitate bit alignment. Typically, such synchro
nization or sync bits do not pass through the scrambler and
descrambler modules of the BERT500. This arrangement is
reflected in FIG. 4, which illustrates various sync bit paths.
One such path 532 is indicated that bypasses the scrambler
512 in the transmit datapath. Another of such sync bit paths
534 is indicated that bypasses the scrambler 522 in the
compare datapath. A further sync bit path 536 is indicated
that bypasses the descrambler 540 of the receive datapath.
Various other data and control paths are provided as well.
For example, the bit aligner 544 transmits an alignment
signal to the control logic module 502 along the aligned
signal path 546, and also transmits a shift count signal
along a shift count signal path 548 to the 64/66 gearbox/bit
shifter 538. Further, the 64/66 block decoder 542 of the
receive datapath communicates error signals to the control
logic module 502 by way of an error signal path 550.
In connection with the foregoing, and as indicated in the
discussion of FIG. 3A, exemplary implementations of the
BERT 500 define various paths that serve as both data and
control signal buses. Examples of Such buses include the bus
554A between the Send RAM 528 and placeholder/PRBS
generator 506, and the bus 554B between the “Compare
RAM 530 and placeholder/PRBS generator 516. As used in
FIG. 3A, the Data/Ctrl busses refer to the control bits used
with XGMII data. Each 8 bits of XGMII data has 1 asso
ciated control bit, which indicates whether that byte is a
data byte or a control byte. For example, FB with a
control bit of 1 means an XGMIISTART character, whereas
FB with a control bit of 0 means simply the data byte FB.
Thus, exemplary implementations of the BERT 500 are
configured to enable a variety of feedback and control
functionalities with respect to BERT operations. Accord
ingly, the embodiment of BERT 500 illustrated in FIG. 4 is
exemplary only and, more generally, the BERT may be
configured to include various additional or alternative feed
back and control functionalities. Consequently, the embodi
ment of the BERT illustrated in FIG. 4 should not be
construed to limit the scope of the invention in any way.
In addition to providing for various internal control and
feedback functionalities, implementations of the BERT 500
are also adapted to interact with various external devices and
control and feedback signals and commands. For example,
the BERT 500 is configured to interact with a clock/trigger
logic module 600 that, in turn, receives a Refclk. In signal
and transmits a Refclk Out signal, as well as sending and
receiving suitable Trigger I/O signals. As described earlier,
implementations of the BERT are also configured such that
various BERT operations can be controlled as well by way
of a host device running BERT control software.
With the foregoing discussion of specific aspects of a
control logic module, and corresponding feedback and con
trol signal buses in view, more particular reference is
directed now to specific operational aspects of the BERT
500. Initially, the BERT 500 is activated when a user
provides an input such as pressing a button, or typing a
command on a command line interface displayed by a GUI,
such as at a host device. The RAM address generator of the
control logic module 502 generates a correct pattern address
and transmits the correct pattern address to the SEND
RAM. The Send RAM then provides the pattern per clock
to the RAM parser of the control logic module 502.
Based on the results generated by the RAM parser,
various options are then made available with regard to the
structure and content of the test bit sequence. Such options
may be exercised automatically by the BERT 500 and/or
US 7,231,558 B2
29
associated Software at a host device, or may be exercised in
the discretion of a user, and include, but are not limited to,
injecting idles or fill words, and defining and filling place
holders. As disclosed elsewhere herein, other devices on the
network path may modify these idles or fill words by
dropping some of them or adding more, in order to maintain
synchronization of the data stream. Examples of various
other options are disclosed elsewhere herein.
The RAM parser of the control logic module also gives
the RAM address generator a command to generate the
correct address based on control bits stored within the
appropriate RAM. Whether, for example, a placeholder
generator or PRBS generator is used depends on the actual
system implemented in the bit error rate system. Thus, if the
bit sequence is pseudo-random, then a PRBS generator will
be used.
As noted earlier in connection with the discussion of FIG.
3A, a CRC checksum module 508 then regenerates and adds
a checksum to the bit sequence generated by the bit sequence
generator 506. The bit sequence is then passed to the 64/66
block encoder 510 and each block of 8 bits in the bit
sequence is encoded into a 66-bit frame. The scrambler 512
then acts on the data portion of the frame to create transitions
and DC balance. The 66-bit frames are then converted back
to 64 bits by the 66:64 gearbox/error injector 514 and
transmitted onto the network by way of the a media interface
700, which exemplarily comprises a 16/64 multiplexer/
demultiplexer 700A and 300 pin XBI 700B.
The transmitted test bit sequence travels along the net
work path and returns through a receive port of the BERT
500, by way of the 300 pin XBI 700B and 16/64 multiplexer/
demultiplexer 700A. The bit sequence is then aligned, as
described earlier, decoded by the 64/66 block decoder 542,
and then passed to the control logic module 502. In particu
lar, the decoded bit sequence received through the receive
datapath is then fed to the start word detector within the
control logic module 502, which detects and identifies the
start word of the bit sequence or word pattern. Because the
design uses 64-bit internal datapaths, and because external
network devices may add and drop fill words with 32-bit
granularity, the start word detection logic is set up to detect
both aligned and unaligned start words, that is, words shifted
by 32 bits. When a start word is detected, the correspond
ing raw bits are used to seed the compare scrambler 522,
as discussed previously, thus synchronizing the compare
datapath output with the received bitstream. By reseeding
the compare scrambler 522 in this way, the BERT 500 is
able to operate in connection with retiming devices that
add/drop idles to/from the bit sequence, while still being
able to perform bit sequence comparisons at the bit level.
This, and other, synchronization operations implemented
in connection with exemplary embodiments of the BERT
500 are enabled by the presence of various appropriate delay
elements that, in general, are effective in Synchronizing
various control and data buses within the BERT 500,
examples of which are described elsewhere herein.
With continuing reference to FIG. 4, the comparator 524
then compares the received bit sequence to the synchronized
bit sequence regenerated from the Compare RAM 530.
Base upon this comparison, the statistics/counter module
552 calculates a bit error rate. Bit errors are accumulated to
measure the bit error rate on a particular network path. This
calculation may be a simple calculation or an average bit
error rate. Also, the statistics/counter module 552 provides
other data to the user through the host GUI as described
above.

In the above-described example, the test bit sequence was
generated and transmitted from a first bi-directional port of
the BERT 500 and received on a second bi-directional port
of the BERT 500. Thus, the test bit sequence generation and
memory channel on the receive port are different than the
one actually used to generate the bit sequence. But if host
software programs the RAMs for both channels with the
same configuration, the receiver port will generate the same
expected bit sequence, for comparison, as the bit sequence
that was sent. As discussed below, exemplary implementa
tions of the BERT500 may also include various features that
enable other types of measurements or error detection char
acteristics listed below.
In particular, exemplary implementations of the BERT
500 are configured to provide 64/66b coding/decoding data
paths, standard jitter patterns, arbitrary pattern entry and, for
network devices that transmit and receive data on multiple
parallel serial channels, or lanes, the BERT 500 may be
configured to provide different patterns per lane, adjustable
lane-to-lane delay, as well as the ability to test each lane
individually.
With particular reference to jitter patterns, exemplary
implementations of the BERT 500 are configured to intro
duce a known amount of jitter to a network test bit data
stream, and thereby enables an assessment as to the ability
of a tested system to perform in connection with a jittered
signal.
Also, exemplary implementations of the BERT 500 pro
vide an adjustable traffic rate and frame size feature, as well
as the ability to measure network latency by transmitting and
receiving packets that include timestamps within the pay
load. Further details concerning exemplary aspects of the
latency measuring aspect are provided below. Finally, the
BERT500 includes, in some implementations, an adjustable
power source for both XBI and XENPAK modules at all
levels, management data input/output (“MDIO) support for
the XENPAK module, and also provides for low delay
SMA-based in/out triggering. Such as pattern clock or trig
ger on error.
Further, exemplary implementations of the he BERT 500
are configured to enable eye-pattern modification. In gen
eral, eye-pattern modification refers to the implementation
of changes to the amplitude and duty cycle of the network
test bit stream. Among other things, this functionality per
mits a user to assess the robustness and sensitivity of
receivers and similar devices.
VIII. Exemplary Aspects of BERT-Implemented Latency
Measurements
As Suggested above, at least Some implementations of the
BERT are configured to measure the latency associated with
a particular network or device, or group of devices. Because
of the value assigned by customers and the industry to
accurate and reliable high speed data transmission, Such
latency measurements are particularly useful in the design,
testing, installation and maintenance of high speed net
works.
While other systems exist to measure latency, such sys
tems are typically implemented by Software. In contrast, the
latency functionality contemplated herein is implemented at
the hardware level within the BERT and thus provides a
relatively higher level of precision and resolution than is
typically obtained with software-based solutions. Moreover,
many known software tools typically measure latency at a
resolution expressed in milliseconds. Such low resolution
levels are ill-suited for use in connection with high speed
networks where latency measurements in units of microsec
US 7,231,558 B2
31
onds or nanoseconds may be desired. In one exemplary
implementation of the BERT, latency measurements as fine
as 10 nanoseconds can be measured. Such resolution is
difficult, if not impossible, for higher-level, software-based
Solutions to achieve.
Moreover, because exemplary implementations of the
BERT are capable of calculating a BER as well as perform
ing latency measurements, the ability of a user to identify
and diagnose problems in the associated network and
devices is enhanced. By way of example, it may be the case
in some instances that if a corrupted data packet is identified
at about the same time that a relatively high latency is
observed, a user may be better able to draw conclusions
about the source of the problem than if, for example, only a
BER was calculated, or only a latency measurement was
made.
Typically, the measurement of latency involves transmis
sion, from the BERT, of frames or other data packets onto
the network and measuring the amount of time required for
such frames to return to the BERT. In at least some imple
mentations, a register is provided in associate with the BERT
that contains an offset value, which may be determined
heuristically, that reflects the amount of time required for the
frame to transit the BERT and other hardware not part of the
system under test. After the BERT has determined the raw
latency value, the offset value is then deducted from that raw
latency value to determine the actual latency of the system
under test.
As in the case of other aspects of exemplary implemen
tations of the BERT disclosed herein, aspects of particular
latency measurements, or latency measurements to be made
in connection with a particular system can be specified and
configured through a GUI and Software operating in con
nection with the BERT. Aspects of exemplary latency con
figuration options are provided below.
In one exemplary implementation, the user can specify
one or more of the following options: reference clock rate;
external clock speed; protocol; and, testing characteristics
such as payload size and the number of idles between
frames. In this implementation, the user can choose between
the 10 G Fibre Channel clock rate of 10.51875 Gbps and the
10 GE clock rate of 10.31250 Gbps. The external clock
speed can be set between 155 MHz and 170 MHz (9.920
Gbps to 10.720 Gbps), while the protocol options include 10
GE protocol, or the 10 G Fibre Channel protocol. Finally,
with respect to payload size and the number of idles between
frames, the payload size option generally allows the use to
control the number of XGMII characters in the payload of
the frame sent, while the idles between frames option
permits the user to control the number of idle characters
between the transmitted frames. Both the payload and the
idles are counted by 8 bytes in this exemplary implemen
tation.
Of course, the foregoing aspects of this implementation of
the BERT are exemplary only. More generally, aspects of the
latency measurements implemented by way of the BERT
may be configured as necessary to Suit the requirements of
a particular application or operating environment. Accord
ingly, the scope of the invention should not be construed to
be limited to the exemplary implementations described
herein.
With particular reference now to FIG. 4, more specific
details are provided concerning operational aspects of a
latency measurement implemented in connection with a
BERT 500. In particular, the placeholder/PRBS generator
block 506 exemplarily contains timestamp insertion logic.
When commanded to do so by the control logic module 502,
5
10
15
25
30
35
40
45
50
55
60
65
32
the placeholder/PRBS generator block 506 inserts a times
tamp, a type of placeholder, into the transmit datastream.
Exemplarily, the timestamp comprises an incrementing
counter generated by the timestamp counter/latency calcu
lation module 554. Typically, the timestamp is inserted in the
data payload of a 10 GE or 10 GFC frame. In one exemplary
BERT implementation, the timestamp counter increments
every 10 nanoseconds and runs constantly.
When the frame returns through the receive datapath of
the BERT 500, the control logic module 502 commands the
timestamp counter/latency calculation module 554 to sub
tract the timestamp value contained in the frame from the
current counter value. This operation yields the time differ
ence between the current time now and the time at which
the frame was sent, that is, the latency. Generally, the
accuracy of this measurement is equal to the timestamp
counter increment period, or 10 nanoseconds in this imple
mentation.
As indicated in FIG. 4, the timestamp is inserted before
the CRC checksum 512 and 64/66 block encoder 510. This
arrangement enables the BERT500 to generate legal traffic
when testing protocol devices. Thus, the timestamp in the
received frame must be decoded again before the latency can
be calculated and, accordingly, the timestamp counter/la
tency calculation module 554 operates on the data output
from the 64:66 block decoder 542.
As in the case of all of the modules in this BERT
implementation, the modules in the receive datapath can be
bypassed to pass through the data at their respective inputs.
Moreover, latency measurements can be implemented in the
64 and 66-bit raw modes as well, in which case both the
descrambler module 540 and the 64:66 block decoder mod
ule 542 would be in a bypass mode.
VIV. General Aspects of Software
As disclosed elsewhere herein, aspects of implementa
tions of the invention may be implemented by way of a host
device and associated software. With respect to the host
device, a special purpose or general purpose computer may
be provided that includes various computer hardware, as
discussed in greater detail below. Embodiments within the
Scope of the present invention also include computer-read
able media for carrying or having computer-executable
instructions or electronic content structures stored thereon.
Such computer-readable media can be any available media
which can be accessed by a general purpose or special
purpose computer.
By way of example, and not limitation, Such computer
readable media can comprise RAM, ROM, EEPROM, CD
ROM or other optical disk storage, magnetic disk storage or
other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which
can be used to carry or store desired program code means in
the form of computer-executable instructions or electronic
content structures and which can be accessed by a general
purpose or special purpose computer. When information is
transferred or provided over a network or another commu
nications connection (either hardwired, wireless, or a com
bination of hardwired or wireless) to a computer, the com
puter properly views the connection as a computer-readable
medium. Thus, any such a connection is properly termed a
computer-readable medium. Combinations of the above
should also be included within the scope of computer
readable media. Computer-executable instructions com
prise, for example, instructions and content which cause a
general purpose computer, special purpose computer, or
special purpose processing device to perform a certain
function or group of functions.
