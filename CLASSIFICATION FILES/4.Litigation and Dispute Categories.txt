Dear [Name]:
It has come to my attention that you have made an unauthorized use of my
copyrighted work entitled [name of work] (“the Work”). I own all rights,

As you neither asked for nor received permission to use the Work as the ba-
sis for [name of infringing work] nor to make or distribute copies, including

rights under 17 U.S.C. Section 101 et seq. [and could be liable for statutory
damages as high as $150,000 as set forth in Section 504(c) (2) therein].*
I demand that you immediately cease the use and distribution of [name of
infringing work] and all other infringing works derived from the Work, and
that you delete or remove from circulation all copies, including electronic
copies, of same; that you deliver to me, if applicable, all unused, undistrib-
uted copies of same, or destroy such copies immediately; and that you desist
from this or any other infringement of my rights in the future. I also require
an accounting of all profits you have made to date from sales or other ex-
ploitation of [name of infringing work]. If I have not received an affirma-
tive response from you by [date–give them about 2 weeks] indicating that
you have fully complied with these requirements, I shall take further action
against you. This letter is written without prejudice to my rights, all of
which are hereby expressly reserved.
Very truly yours,

Re: Account #123456789
Dear Sir or Madam:
I am writing to ask that you stop communications to me about my account with Amy's
Department Store, as required by the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.
I was laid off from work two months ago and can’t pay this bill at this time. I am now in a
training program that ends in March and hope to find work that will let me to make payments
soon after that.
You should know that your employees have engaged in illegal collection practices. For
example, I got a phone call at 6:30 a.m. from one of them last week. Later that day, the same
person called me at my training program. Personal phone calls are not allowed except for
emergencies. My family and I were very upset by these tactics.
Stop contacting me.
I will take care of this matter when I can. Your cooperation is appreciated.
Sincerely,
____________________________________________________

Sample Interrogatories
The following interrogatories are to be reviewed and used as applicable to the facts of
each case; delete and add as appropriate. These interrogatories are also available online as
companion material to this treatise. NCLC’s Fair Debt Collection treatises discusses discovery
issues that have been addressed in fair debt collection opinions.
Federal Rule Civil Procedure 33(a) limits the number of interrogatories to 25

discovery, the following sample interrogatories must be reduced to 25 interrogatories.
Many states have adopted standard instructions and/or definitions for discovery requests
that can or should be incorporated into appropriate discovery requests. A reference to the local

F.3 Sample First Request for Production of Documents
This is a sample form for demonstration purposes only, and must be adopted by a competent
professional to meet the individual facts and local procedural rules. This request is based on
discovery materials prepared by consumer law practitioners in three different cases.1 It is
intended to be adaptable for both loans and credit sales.
In most cases, a simplified first document request should be served as soon as
practicable in the case. The request could ask for the loan file, documents that will be
introduced into evidence, and any documents relating to any assignment of the loan or showing
who actually owns the loan. Such a request will help refine claims and is relevant and
unobjectionable.
[plaintiff]Plaintiff
[vs]
[defendant]Defendant
[action]Civ. No. _________

set prepared by Attorney Diane Thompson of the Land of Lincoln Legal Assistance Foundation
in East St. Louis, Illinois, in a mortgage loan case; and a set prepared by Attorney Irv Ackelsberg
of Community Legal Services in Philadelphia in a mortgage loan case.
D. If your response to any requests herein is that the documents are not in your control,
identify who has control and the location of the records, and provide any documents you have
that contain all or part of the information contained in the requested document or category.
E. If any requested document was, but no longer is in your possession or subject to your
control, or has been misplaced, destroyed or discarded, or otherwise disposed of, please so state,
and for each such document provide:
(1) Its date;
(2) The identity of the person(s) who prepared the document;
(3) The identity of all persons who participated in preparing the document, to whom
the document was sent or who have otherwise seen the document;
(4) The length of the document;

that the file be copied to a disk in one of the following formats in descending order of preference:
[Preferred Formats].
H. When a document exists in a computer disk as a word processing file, Plaintiff
requests that the file be copied to a floppy disk in one of the following formats in descending
order of preference: [Preferred Formats].
I. The Document Requests are to be considered continuing, and supplemental documents
must be submitted by Defendant upon discovering or becoming aware of additional responsive
documents.
J. If any paragraph of this request is believed to be ambiguous or unduly burdensome,
please contact the undersigned and an effort will be made to remedy the problem.
DEFINITIONS
A. “Document” is used in the broadest possible sense and means, without limitation, any
written, printed, typed, digitized, photostated, photographic, computerized, recorded, or
otherwise reproduced communication or representation, whether comprised of letters, words,
numbers, pictures, sounds or symbols, or any combination thereof. It includes the original and
any nonidentical copies thereof, whether different from the originals by reason of any notation
made on such copies or otherwise, and includes every document that is or has been in the
possession, control, or custody of Defendant or of which Defendant has knowledge, whether
originals or copies. It includes but is not limited to contracts, notes, memoranda,
correspondence, diaries, desk or other calendars, statistics, letters, telegrams, minutes, business
records, personal records, account statements, reports, studies, checks, receipts, bills, returns,
charts, summaries, pamphlets, books, notations of any sort of conversations, written agreements,
bulletins, printed matter, computer printouts, electronic mail, data compilations from which
information can be obtained, teletypes, telefax, worksheets, logs, forms, bank statements, books
of account, ledgers, or invoices, all drafts, alterations, modifications, changes and amendments of
any of the foregoing, graphic or oral records or representations of any kind, including but not
limited to tapes, cassettes, discs, recordings, computer memories, and other information that is
recorded electronically, digitally, or by similar means.
B. The term “person” shall include a natural person, partnership, corporation, joint
venture, association, or other group however organized.
C. The term “transaction,” when used without qualification, means the transaction
consummated by the Plaintiff [date and description].
REQUESTS TO PRODUCE
IMPORTANT: All questions containing the terms “document,” “person,” or
“transaction” must be answered in accordance with the definitions of those terms contained in
the attached instructions.
REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION
1. All contracts, including modifications thereto, to which Plaintiff is a party, including
any and all broker agreements.2
2 In the alternative, this and the next five document requests can be replaced with a single request
such as “All documents pertaining to the credit transaction underlying this action, including but
not limited to the entire contents of the files and the inside and outside of the front and back of
the file folders for this transaction, all documents signed by defendant, disclosures, applications,
correspondence, work sheets, underwriting forms, file notations and any other document.”
2. All documents relating or referring to Plaintiff, or which are indexed, filed or
retrievable under Plaintiff’s name or any number, symbol, designation or code (such as an
account number or Social Security number) assigned to Plaintiff.
3. All disclosure statements given to Plaintiff and any other notices of Plaintiff’s rights.
4. All credit applications from Plaintiff or relating or referring to Plaintiff’s credit
application.
5. Your complete file as to this transaction and Plaintiff’s account, including the outside
and inside of the front and back of your file folder for this credit transaction.
6. All ledger cards or ledger sheets or other documents reflecting payments, credits, late
charges, other charges, and rebates posted to Plaintiff’s account.3
7. Copies of all payments received from Plaintiff.
8. All correspondence, telephone log sheets, or other internal memoranda or notes
concerning Plaintiff’s account, or relating or referring to the account.
9. All correspondence, telephone log sheets, or other internal memoranda or notes
concerning or reflecting communications with _________.4
10. All documents relating or referring to any fees, commissions or payments you
received in connection with the loan transactions, including sale of insurance, from anyone other
than Plaintiff.5
11. All documents reflecting, or relating or referring to, commissions and/or bonuses
paid to any person in connection with this loan transaction, including sale of insurance.
12. Copies of both sides of the (i) bills and (ii) checks, wire transfers or other payment
instruments for each disbursement in relation to the transaction, issued by anyone in connection
with this transaction, including all compensation paid to brokers whether as part of closing or
outside closing.
3 This and the next request will help determine the tender amount in a TILA rescission case, and
the amount of enhanced damages in a HOEPA case. They are also relevant to a determination of
the balance owing on the debt if the creditor has counterclaimed.
4 This request can be filled in to request correspondence with settlement service providers, home
improvement contractors, brokers, or others involved in the transaction. These documents may
help show that payments that were ostensibly made to third parties should actually be included in
the finance charge, or in the points and fees for HOEPA purposes. They may also show that the
creditor had such a close relationship with parties who acted fraudulently that it should be liable
for their fraud.
5 The documents listed in this and the next four requests will help determine whether any of the
components of the amount financed should actually have been included in the finance charge and
whether they should have been included as points and fees for purposes of HOEPA.
13. All appraisal requests, appraisals of the property, invoices for appraisals, review
appraisals, broker price opinions, or other valuations of the property, and proofs of payment for
appraisals, and all documents relating or referring to any such appraisal or other valuation of the
property.
14. Proof of payment to credit reporting services related to Plaintiff’s closing.
15. If the current obligation resulted from a refinancing of an earlier obligation, all
documents that relate or refer to the earlier obligation, including but not limited to: (a) the
contract; (b) all disclosure statements; (c) the ledger sheet or other record, showing all payments,
credits, late charges, other charges, and rebates; (d) documentation of the date, amount, and
calculation of any rebates of finance charges, credit insurance, or other charges; (e) the mortgage
or security agreement, if any; (f) all correspondence; (g) the calculation of the payoff amount.
16. All documents that show, relate, or refer to the assignment or negotiation of the note,
including any agreements between the assignor and assignee relating to the assignment of
obligations. If there has been more than one assignment, please produce these documents for
each assignment.6
17. All documents that show, relate, or refer to the assignment of the mortgage,7
including any agreements between the assignor and assignee relating to the assignment of
obligations. If there has been more than one assignment, please produce these documents for
each assignment.8
18. All powers of attorney or other documents on which the servicer or other entity may
be relying to act on behalf of the loan originator, holder, or assignee of the note and/or mortgage
and any documents which may refer or relate to such enabling documents.9
6 This request helps identify potential defendants, since an assignee is liable for rescission and, if
the violations are apparent on the face of the transaction, is also liable for TILA damages. See
Chs. 10, 12, supra. It is also useful for determining the scope of potential holder in due course
defenses. If the document assigned was an installment sales contract rather than a note, the
request should be revised accordingly.
7 The mortgage under most state law should follow the note. However, sometimes the note and
mortgage are assigned separately. While the separate assignment of the mortgage may be a
nullity under state law, it is possible that additional claims, sources of discovery, or defendants
may be identified from the documents produced in response to this request.
8 This request is relevant only if the transaction included a mortgage.
9 Sometimes, the original lender may execute a power of attorney to the servicer at the time of
the transaction. This document may permit the servicer to prepare assignments of the mortgage
and endorsements of the note as an attorney-in-fact. These agency relationships may be
important for TILA claims, Fair Debt Collection Practices Act claims, joint venture claims, or
possible holder in due course defenses by the holder or servicer. For discussions of the holder-
in-due-course doctrine and exceptions to its reach, see National Consumer Law Center, Mortgage
Lending § 10.7 (2012); National Consumer Law Center, Unfair and Deceptive Acts and Practices
§ 11.7.2 (7th ed. 2008 and Supp.).
19. Each and every document that was transmitted to [the assignee] by [the assignor] in
connection with the negotiation or assignment of the note or mortgage.10
20. All documents which constitute or reflect communications between you and public or
private agencies that receive consumer complaints (such as an Attorney General’s office, the
Federal Trade Commission, a Better Business Bureau or newspaper column) relating to
transactions since 1999.11
21. Any administrative complaint or other documents showing, relating to, or referring to
enforcement proceedings instituted against you or any other holder, assignee, or originator of this
obligation from [date] to [date] regarding TILA.12
22. All agreements, solicitations, correspondence or other documents relating or referring
the purchase of loans by [Assignee] from [Original Creditor or prior assignee], including loan
purchase master agreements, solicitations, correspondence or other documents, whether relating
to this loan or other loans.13
23. All documents that concern, refer, or relate to any instructions or policies to [Original
Creditor’s or broker’s] agents or employees concerning its brokering of [type of obligation, e.g.,
residential mortgages].
24. All contracts between you and any of the other Defendants or [settlement service
provider] in this action.14
25. All documents that relate or refer to any relationship, affiliation, or course of conduct
between you and any of the other Defendants or [settlement service provider] in this action.
10 Whether the assignee is liable for TILA damages depends on whether the violations were
apparent on the face of the “disclosure statement or other documents assigned” in a non-
mortgage transaction or “the disclosure statement, any itemization of the amount financed, the
note, or any other disclosure of disbursement” in a transaction secured by real property. See Ch.
12, supra. If the transaction involved an installment sales contract rather than a note, or did not
involve a mortgage, the request should be revised accordingly.
11 This request is relevant to any claim of a bona fide error. It is also extremely important for
establishing pattern and practice evidence.
12 Certain administrative actions can extend the three-year rescission period. See § 10.6.3.3.6,
supra.
13 This and the next two document requests relate to assignee liability under HOEPA and TILA.
They also may help show the assignee’s liability for state law claims. If the current holder
purchased the obligation from an intermediate assignee, the request should be revised to reflect
that fact.
14 Affiliations among the defendants, or between a defendant and a settlement service provider,
may help establish that certain closing costs count toward the HOEPA points and fees trigger.
The documents showing contracts and other affiliations among the defendants that this and the
next request seek may also help establish assignee liability under HOEPA by showing the
assignee’s opportunity to determine that the obligation was covered by HOEPA.
26. All documents that discuss or refer to your procedures for ensuring compliance with,
and your actual compliance or lack of compliance with, the requirements of the Truth in Lending
Act, including but not limited to documents that were used to check for compliance from [date]
through [date].15
27. All manuals, memoranda, instructions, and other documents setting forth your
policies, procedures or practices relating to [loan origination or purchase] of [type of obligation,
e.g., residential mortgages].16
28. The underwriting guidelines and rate sheets that were in effect at the time of the loan
transaction at issue in this case, and any written material, including definitions, memoranda,
directives or other documents that explain, illustrate, apply, elucidate or pertain to those
underwriting guidelines, including the rate sheet that was used to determine the interest rate
Plaintiff would pay in this transaction or the “par” rate.17
29. All appraisal guidelines, appraisal watch lists or appraisal suspension lists maintained
during the relevant period either by the Assignee or Original Creditor.
30. Any and all documents concerning reviews of [appraiser] in the case or review of
appraisals performed by [appraiser] in the case, whether in this transaction or another
transaction.18
31. All guidelines, manuals, memoranda regarding supervision or internal monitoring of
brokers, brokered loans, or the performance of individual brokers, including broker watch lists or
broker suspension lists or other similar documents however denominated.19
15 This and the next request are relevant to any claim by the creditor that the TILA violation
resulted from a bona fide error. The documents may also help establish assignee liability by
showing what documents the loan originator provided to the assignee. In a HOEPA case these
documents may help show that the assignee knew, or could have ascertained through due
diligence, that the transaction was covered by HOEPA.
16 This document may bear on whether the defendant can claim a bona fide error. This and the
next three requests also may help show whether the originator engaged in a pattern or practice of
lending without regard to the consumer’s repayment ability, which is a violation if the transaction
is covered by HOEPA.
17 This request is relevant if a yield spread premium was charged and the consumer is trying to
show that it should count as points and fees for purposes of HOEPA. See § 9.9.3.4, supra. It is
also relevant in HOEPA cases to show whether the defendant made the loan without regard to the
borrower’s repayment ability.
18 Documents showing that the lender knew the appraiser was overstating the value can turn an
appraisal fee into a finance charge as well as bolster fraud and consumer fraud or joint venture
claims.
19 This question and the following are only relevant where there is a broker involved in the loan.
32. Any and all documents, however denominated, concerning [broker in the case],
whether master contracts, broker monitoring, broker watch list, correspondence, telephone logs,
internal memoranda and the performance of loans originated by the broker.
33. Any and all documents relating to any sampling of the loan pool containing the
instant note or other documents reflecting the performance of loans grouped with this loan or
originated by the same broker or creditor.
34. Any and all documents pertaining to or relating or referring to Assignee’s decision to
purchase or not purchase HOEPA (Section 32) loans or to the structuring of loans so as not to
trigger Section 32.20
35. If a third-party investor holds any interest in the obligation underlying this action, or
if this obligation has been or is part of a pool of obligations that have been securitized, all
prospectuses, pooling and servicing agreements or reports concerning that loan pool, including
documents which describe the investment and those that describe the performance of the loans in
such pool, and all documents relating or referring to same.21
36. Your most current annual report.
37. All documents relating or referring to any powers of attorney on which the servicer
or other entity may be relying to act on behalf of the loan originator, holder, or assignee of the
note and/or mortgage.22
38. All insurance policies that may afford coverage with respect to the matters
complained of, together with all correspondence accepting or declining coverage or reserving
rights with respect thereto.23
39. All documents setting forth your document destruction and retention policies, and all
documents that relate or refer to same.
20 This request should only be made if the loan is a HOEPA loan.
21 This and the next request are relevant to HOEPA loans. The documents produced may show
whether the holder of the obligation claims that it does not purchase HOEPA loans, and may also
show what “due diligence” it claims to perform on the loans it purchases.
22 Sometimes, the original lender may execute a power of attorney to the servicer at the time of
the transaction. This document may permit the servicer to prepare assignments of the mortgage
and endorsements of the note as an attorney-in-fact. This issue may be worth exploring because
the note holder may not have acquired holder-in-due-course status if the endorsement occurred

Justice Tarlok Singh Chauhan Since, somewhat identical issues of fact and law are involved in these
batch of writ petitions, therefore, they have been decided by this common judgment.
Case of the Petitioner(s):
1.1. The petitioners are power generation companies .
engaged in the production of the electricity by using river water. They own, operate and maintain
the hydropower projects. The petitioners after entering into agreements with the Government of
Himachal Pradesh are running the projects. The petitioners seek to assail the legislative
competence, the constitutional validity and the vires of the Himachal Pradesh Water Cess on
Hydropower Generation Act, 2023 (hereinafter to be referred to as the "Act"), inter alia, on the
following grounds:
(i) The State lacks legislative competence/power as per Article 265 of the
Constitution of India.
(ii) The legislative powers of the Union Government or the State Government have
been so demarcated and specified by way of Seventh Schedule under List-I known as
Union List, List-II known as State List, List-III known as Concurrent List. Thus, the
State Government has legislative powers under Article 265 of Constitution of India to
levy any cess only if the same finds mention in List-II. However, none of entries
under List-II or the State List empowers the State Government to levy cess/tax on
water usage for the purpose of generation of .
electricity, as has been done by the State Government.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193385936/
6Cwp No. 2916/2023 vs State Of H.P. & Ors on 5 March, 2024
(iii) Entry 53 of List-II empowers the State Government to levy tax/cess in respect of electricity,
however, that entry is not applicable and does not empower the State Government to levy cess on
water usage for the purpose of generation of hydro electricity.
(iv) The State cannot take recourse to entry No.17 of list-II for defending its impugned Act as the
same firstly does not empower the State Govt. to levy a tax or cess on water and secondly, even for
the sake of arguments, if entry No. 17 of List Il so empowers the State Government, the impugned
Act cannot become operative in view of the non-
compliance of the provisions of Article 288 of Constitution of India.
(v) The State Government by way of provisions of the Act has vested with itself non-consumptive
usage of water of inter-state rivers, which amounts to encroaching upon the legislative powers of the
Union Government, as under List-I of the Seventh Schedule by way of entry No.56, it is only the .
Union Government, which has the legislative powers with respect to interstate rivers and river
valleys.
(vi) The Hydroelectric Power Projects of the petitioners are Central Sector Hydroelectric Power
Projects built over inter-state rivers, namely, Ravi and Beas and its tributaries, with the sanction of
the Union Government and, therefore, any restriction imposed by the State Government in the
usage of water flowing from the said rivers by way of seeking sanction for non consumptive usage of
river water and further by way of levy of cess on such non-
consumptive use of inter-state river water for generation of electricity, is wholly illegal and invalid
being beyond the legislative competence/power of the State Government.
(vii) The Govt. of India, Ministry of Power taking note of the fact that some of the States have
imposed taxes/duties on generation of electricity in the guise of water tax/cess, vide letter dated
25.04.2023 had called upon all the Chief Secretaries of the State Governments and Union .
Territories not to levy such tax/duty/cess being contrary to the constitutional provisions and the
same be promptly withdrawn.
(viii) Section 10 of the Act and Rule 7 of Himachal Pradesh Water Cess from Hydro Power
Generation Rules, 2023 (for short "the Rules") have impact of taking away the rights that have been
crystallized or vested on the petitioners. The impugned Act has a retrospective effect. Even though,
the Legislature is entitled to make an enactment with retrospective effect, but it cannot take away
the rights that have already been vested in the petitioners.
(ix) The provisions of the Act go to show that two conditions are required to be fulfilled for levy of
cess. One is that water is drawn from the source and another is that drawl of such water is for
generation of electricity. If one of the conditions is lacking, the levy of cess is not attracted. So, in
"pith and substance" levy of cess is on generation of electricity. The State lacks the competence to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193385936/
7Cwp No. 2916/2023 vs State Of H.P. & Ors on 5 March, 2024
levy cess or tax on generation of electricity because this field is reserved for Parliament under entries
.
No. 84 and 97 of List-I of Seventh Schedule. This colourable exercise of power by the State is
unconstitutional.
(x) The impugned Act is also bad in law as it is violative of Article 300A of Constitution of India.
(xi) The impugned Act is also hit by Article 288 of Constitution of India as it was not reserved for the
consideration of the Hon'ble President and Presidential ascent has not been obtained before
enforcing the impugned Act.
(xii) Since, majority of the rivers and their tributaries, over which the Hydro Power Projects have
been constructed, are inter-State, therefore, they are covered by entry 56 of list-I of Seventh
Schedule of the Constitution. Thus, the State Govt. is not competent to make any law regarding
inter-State rivers.
(xiii) The impugned Act is repugnant to Section 62 read with section 79 of Electricity Act, 2003 as
the said Central Act of 2003 provides for the fixation of tariff for electricity is to be vested with the
Central Electricity Regulatory Commission.
.
(xiv) The State of Himachal Pradesh lacks the legislative competence to levy tax/cess on water use
for the generation of hydro electricity since the said levy directly relates to the power generated and
transferred outside the State of Himachal Pradesh.
(xv) No public purpose or objective sought to be achieved has been provided in the impugned Act
and it has far-reaching effects on the general public and is therefore, liable to be struck down on this
ground as well.
(xvi) The levy of tax/cess on use of water is contrary to Articles 14 & 19 of the Constitution of India
as the said levy is arbitrary and; because extremely high rates have been notified, it would render the
projects of petitioners totally unviable.
(xvii) The impugned Act is framed as taxing the drawl of water, whereas, in essence, it is taxing the
generation of electricity which is impermissible in law.
(xviii) The Act seeks to charge the water cess based the head of the turbine. Thus, the water cess
sought to be charged is directly relatable to the head. The .
levy of cess under the Act is based on the premise of higher the head, the more will be electricity
generated for the same value of the water used.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193385936/
8Cwp No. 2916/2023 vs State Of H.P. & Ors on 5 March, 2024
Therefore, the impugned Act seeks to levy cess on the generation of the electricity/hydropower and
not drawl of the water alone.
(xix) There is no entry in List-II which empowers the State to levy a tax on the generation of the
electricity and hence, impugned enactment is void abinitio.
(xx) Tax is imposed on "user" who is the person, who draws the water for generation of the
electricity.
Therefore, taxable event is not mere drawl of water but the drawl of water for the generation of
electricity.
(xxi) The Act is unconstitutional since the charging section does not lay down any guidelines,
limitations or safeguards. Therefore, such legislative architecture suffers from the vice of the
excessive delegation and thereby violative of Article 14 plainly and is thus void.
(xxii) Since, there is no provision providing for an .
opportunity of personal hearing, thereby the Act not only violates the principles of natural justice
but is violative and ultra vires of the Article 14 of the Constitution of India.
(xxiii) The impugned Act is otherwise illegal as Section 30 thereof is in contradiction to Section 28.
(xxiv) The Act otherwise is liable to be struck down in absence of there being any provision for
having a judicial member when admittedly the power to determine the cess has been assigned or
given to a Commission exercising quasi judicial functions.
(xxv) The impugned Act of the State is also contrary to the principles of promissory estoppel as at
the time of investment of thousand of crores of rupees in the setting up of the Hydro Power Projects
in the State of Himachal Pradesh, the implication upon the petitioners was to provide 12% or 13% of
the power generated free of cost to the home state, but at all material times, the entire basis of
investment in the State of Himachal Pradesh was that the basic and fundamental resource for
hydroelectric power generation i.e. water would be freely .
available to the petitioners and now the State Government cannot turn around and is bound by the
principles of promissory estoppel.
Defence of the State:
2.1. Since water is a State's subject matter and comes under entry 17 of List-II,
therefore, the State has legislative competence to make law and hence there is no
violation of article 265 of the Constitution of India.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193385936/
9Cwp No. 2916/2023 vs State Of H.P. & Ors on 5 March, 2024
2.2. Cess has not been levied on generation of electricity under entry No. 53, but has
been levied for usage charges on water under entry No. 17 of list-II.
2.3. Further, under entries No. 17, 18, 45, 49 and 50 of List-II, the State can also
impose tax on water. As such cess is not on electricity generation or on electric units,
as alleged.
2.4. Levy of cess on usage of water for hydropower generation is not in violation of
Article 288 of the Constitution of India as the issue in the instant case is not about
sale and purchase of water and electricity. Tax is not in respect of the water or
electricity stored, generated, consumed distributed or sold by any authority
established by any existing law or for any law made by the Parliament for regulating
or developing inter-State river or river valley as such it does not come .
under entry No. 56 of List-I, rather it is a cess on non-
consumptive use of water meant for usage of water by the hydropower projects, which does not fall
under article 288(1) of the Constitution of India and there is no violation of any provisions of The
Rivers Boards Act, 1956 and the Inter-State River Water Disputes Act, 1956.
2.5. Cess has been levied by the Act for usage/drawn storage under entry No. 17 of List-II, i.e. for
development, management, maintenance and conservation of water resources of the State by
creating additional revenue sources on this account, as such directions, as contained in
communication dated 25.4.2023 (supra), being not mandatory, are not required to be adopted by
the State.
2.6. The Act has come into force w.e.f. 10.3.2023, whereunder existing and forthcoming hydropower
projects/ registered users are liable to pay water cess under Section 10(1) and Section 10(2) of the
Act for the water usage/water drawn w.e.f. 10.3.2023. Most of the projects have been commissioned
since long back and debt servicing period of these projects have been completed as such there will be
no impact on the viability of project due to levying of water cess.
2.7. The Act does not violate Article 300A of the .
Constitution of India. The petitioners have no absolute and exclusive right over the water use for
generation of the hydropower. The provisions of the agreements signed between the Government of
Himachal Pradesh and Hydropower Projects allow it to build, own, operate & maintain the projects,
therefore, the petitioners cannot claim exclusive and absolute right on water.
2.8. The Act does not violate rights of the petitioners under Articles 14, 19 and even 300A of the
Constitution of India.
2.9. The Act levies cess on usage of water (non-

consumptive use) on hydropower projects and is not in violation of Articles 200 and 288(2) of the
Constitution of India, rather it is in conformity with the provisions as laid down under entries No.
17, 18, 45, 48, 49 and 50 of List-II of Seventh Schedule.
2.10. The State Government is absolutely competent to legislate charges on usage of water under
entry No. 17 of List-
II from natural water resources situated within the territory of the State Government and the Act
does not create any dispute with regard to inter-State rivers water.
2.11. Levy of cess under the Act on usage of water on .
hydropower projects has been charged for development, maintenance, management and
conservation of water resources of the State by creating additional financial resources for this
purpose.
2.12. All the provisions contained in the impugned Act, more particularly, Sections 2, 10, 15, 16 and
17 are made in light with the objective of the impugned Act for its implementation. The provisions of
the Act do not violate the fundamental rights of the petitioners under Articles 14, 19(1)(g), 246 and
265 of the Constitution of India.
Stand of the Union of India:
3.1. The Union of India has filed short affidavits and one of such affidavits is found in CWP
No.5410/2023, titled as GMR Bajoli Holi Hydro Power Ltd. Vs State of H.P., wherein it has
questioned the competence of the State legislature in enacting the Act. It would be relevant to
reproduce paragraphs 2 to 11 of the same, which read as under:
"2. That the powers to levy taxes/duties are specifically stated in the VII Schedule.
List -II of the VII Schedule lists the powers of levying of taxes/duties by the States in
entries-45 to 63. No taxes/duties which have not been specifically mentioned in this
list can be levied by the State Governments under any guise whatsoever-as .
Residuary powers are with the Central Government.
3. That, Entry-53 of List-II (State List) authorizes the States to put taxes on
consumption or sale of electricity in its jurisdiction. This does not include the power
to impose any tax or duty on the generation of electricity. This is because electricity
generated within the territory of one State may be consumed in other States and no
State has the power to levy taxes/duties on residents of other States.
4. That State Legislature under the List II of the Seventh Schedule of The
Constitution of India, does not have the Legislative power or the Constitutional
mandate to make or promulgate any law pertaining to imposition of tax on the water
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193385936/
11Cwp No. 2916/2023 vs State Of H.P. & Ors on 5 March, 2024
drawn by any person much less for non-
consumptive usage of water drawn for generation of electricity.
5. That Article 248 of The Constitution of India, 1950, states as under "248.
Residuary power of Legislation (1) Parliament has exclusive power to make any law
with respect to any matter not enumerated in the Concurrent List or State List.
(2) Such power shall include the power of making any law imposing a tax not
mentioned in either of those Lists."
A reading of the above Article manifests, that the Constitution of India envisaged that in respect of
any matter which is not enumerated in the State List, the Parliament has the exclusive power to
make any laws in respect of the said matter. The same includes the power of imposing a tax not
mentioned in the State List or in the .
concurrent List. This ground is further cemented by the provisions of entry 97 List I (Union List)
Schedule VII -
"Any other matter not numerated in List II or III including any tax not mentioned
either of those lists).
6. That no item provided either in the State List or the Concurrent List, is pertaining
to taxation or taxes on usage of water or otherwise, therefore the State Government of
Himachal Pradesh does not have the Legislative competence or mandate to make or
frame any laws pertaining to imposition of taxes on the water drawn for the purposes
of generation of electricity in the State of Himachal Pradesh. Hence the provisions of
Chapters 3 to 5 seeking to levy and impose Water Tax on generation of electricity are
unconstitutional. Hence enactment of the said Act and its consequent promulgation
and notification is contrary to the provisions of Article 245, 246 and 286 of The
Constitution of India, besides other Articles of The Constitution of India mentioned
first hereinabove.
7. That the State of Himachal Pradesh has imposed taxes / duties on generation of
electricity under the guise of levying a cess on the use of water for generating
electricity. However, though the State may call it a water Tax/cess, it is actually a tax
on the generation of electricity - the tax is to be collected ultimately from the
consumers of electricity who may happen to be residents in other State.
8. That Article -286 of the Constitution explicitly prohibits States from imposing any
taxes /duties on supply of goods or services or on both where the supply takes place
outside the State.

12Cwp No. 2916/2023 vs State Of H.P. & Ors on 5 March, 2024
9. That the power to make a law imposing tax upon the electricity sold outside the
State, i.e. inter-State sales, has been vested exclusively under Entry 92A of List-I read
with Article 286 of The Constitution of India, 24. Government, GOVT Purchase
which contemplates taxes on to the Union the sale or of goods other than
newspapers, where such sale or purchase takes place in the course of inter-State trade
or Commerce.
10. That Entry 54 of List-II of Schedule-VII of The Constitution of India contemplates
enacting a law by the State Government in regard to imposition of tax on sale or
purchase of goods other than newspaper subject to Entry 92A of List-I, which entry
in List 1 empowers solely the Union to make laws for levy of tax on Inter State Sale of
Electricity. Additionally none of the above two entries in List II contemplate levy of
Cess/ Tax on electricity generated.
11. That Articles-287 and 288 prohibit the imposition of taxes on consumption or sale
of electricity consumed by the Central Government or sold to the Central
Government for consumption by the Government or its agencies. As per Entry-56 of
the Union List of the Constitution of India, regulations of issues related to Inter-State
Rivers come under the purview of the Centre. Most of the Hydro-Electric Plants in
the State are located/proposed to be developed on inter- State Rivers. Any imposition
of tax on the non-consumptive use of water of these rivers for electricity generation is
in violation of provisions of the Constitution of India."
Question arising for determination:
4.1. In order to better appreciate the arguments and .
deliberations, this Court deems it fit to formulate points that arise for consideration in these
petitions and thereafter deliberate and decide them. The arguments have been addressed by the
respective counsel(s) appearing for the parties, some of which are overlapping and repetitive in
essence.
4.2. From the pleadings of the parties and arguments that have been addressed in detail, some of the
key challenges may be noted and shall henceforth be referred to as points for consideration:
1. It is misnomer that the tax is levied on water, whereas it is on generation of
electricity, and therefore, not a water tax.
2. The State Legislature is not competent to legislate the Act.
3. In the Act, there is no taxing provision. Tax has been imposed by way of
notifications by the concerned Secretary to the Government of Himachal Pradesh. It
is an executive act. It is not a tax levied by a statute. The act of levying of tax is an
excessive delegation by the State Legislature.

.
Arguments of Mr. Tushar Mehta, learned Senior Advocate for the Petitioners:
5.1. Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners would urge that in order to enable the State
Legislature to levy any tax, the field of legislation should explicitly fall within the purview of Articles
246 & 248(2) of the Constitution. The taxing entry should be distinct. Learned counsel would also
argue that cess is a misnomer as it is a tax for all intents and purposes.
5.2. In order to buttress his arguments, he would refer to Sections 2(c),2(h),2(i)2(g),3,10,12,15,17
and 34 of the 'Act'.
The learned counsel for the petitioners has also made a reference to the notification dated
16.2.2023, which prescribes different rates of cess depending upon the available head i.e. height, to
urge that the cess is nothing but a tax as it provides for different slabs of cess. In support of his
arguments, learned Senior Counsel has referred to the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
Union of India and Another vs. Mohit Mineral Private Limited1, wherein difference between tax, fee
and cess has been culled out.
5.3. During the course of the arguments, various .
constitutional provisions have also been referred to by the learned counsel for the petitioner, like
Articles 245, 246, 248, 265, 286, Entry No. 42, 56, 84, 92A, 97 of List I, Entry 7, 17, 18, 45, 48,49, 53
of List II and entry No. 38 of List -III.
5.4. It is urged that Article 286 deals with supply of goods outside the State and as per the settled
law 'electricity' is a 'good' and is normally supplied by the petitioners' projects outside the State. The
word used in the article is 'supply of goods' and 'not generation of goods' and thus the State lacks
competence to enact the law. Even under entry 56 of List-I, this power is exclusively vested with the
Union of India and as per entry 84 only the goods manufactured can at best be taxed and even the
Parliament cannot impose tax on 'generation of electricity'.
5.5. It is then argued that taking the case of the State at its best, that it was under the residuary
powers that the tax has been imposed, even then such power is not vested with the State and rather
is expressly and exclusively vested with the Union of India under entry 97 of List-I. The reliance
2019 (2) SCC 599 placed upon by the State on entry No. 17 of List-II is of no avail as tax entry has to
be specific in any one of the lists and cannot be inferred. Under this provision the State can only .
regulate the water but cannot tax it; for it is not a taxing entry.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193385936/
14Cwp No. 2916/2023 vs State Of H.P. & Ors on 5 March, 2024
The State cannot even fall back on entry No. 51 as it does not pertain to nor does it contain a
reference to 'electricity'.
5.6. Now, as regards entry No. 38 of list-III, which is the concurrent list, the State can only regulate
electricity, but cannot tax it. For this, there has to a specific provision contained in the Constitution
itself. The State can also not be permitted to fall back on entry No. 47, as there has to be quid pro
quo for being termed as a 'fee' not a 'tax'.
5.7. In order to buttress his arguments, further the learned Counsel has then referred to and placed
reliance on the letter dated 25.04.2023 issued by the Union of India and has vehemently argued that
the State is not competent to impose water tax and cess. The relevant portion of the letter reads as
under:-
"It has come to the notice of the Government of India (Gol) that some State
Governments have imposed taxes/duties on generation of electricity. This is illegal
and unconstitutional. Any tax/duty on generation of electricity, which encompasses
all types of generation viz. Thermal, Hydro, Wind, Solar, Nuclear, etc. is illegal and
unconstitutional. The Constitutional provisions are as follows:
(i) The powers to levy taxes/duties are specifically stated in the VII Schedule. List II
of the VII Schedule .
lists the powers of levying of taxes duties by the States in entries-45 to 63. No taxes/duties which
have not been specifically mentioned in this list can be levied by the State Governments under any
guise whatsoever - as Residuary powers are with the Central Government.
(ii) Entry-53 of List-II (State List) authorizes the States to put taxes on consumption or sale of
electricity in its jurisdiction. This does not include the power to impose any tax or duty on the
generation of electricity. This is because electricity generated within the territory of one State may
be consumed in other States and no State has the power to levy taxes/duties on residents of other
States.
(iii) Some States have imposed taxes/duties on generation of electricity under the guise of levying a
cess on the use of water for generating electricity. However, though the State may call it a water cess,
it is actually a tax on the generation of electricity the tax is to be collected from the consumers of
electricity who may happen to be residents in other State.
(iv) Article-286 of the Constitution explicitly prohibits States from imposing any taxes/duties on
supply of goods or services or on both where the supply takes place outside the State.
(v) Articles-287 and 288 prohibit the imposition of taxes on consumption or sale of electricity
consumed .
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193385936/
15Cwp No. 2916/2023 vs State Of H.P. & Ors on 5 March, 2024
by the Central Government or sold to the Central Government for consumption by the Government
or its agencies.
(vi) As per Entry-56 of the Union List of the Constitution of India, regulations of issues related to
Inter-State Rivers come under the purview of the Centre. Most of the Hydro-Electric Plants in the
States are located/ proposed to be developed on Inter-State Rivers. Any imposition of tax on the
non-
consumptive use of water of these rivers for electricity generation is in violation of provisions of the
Constitution of India.
(vii) Hydro Power Projects do not consume water to produce electricity. Electricity is generated by
directing the flow of water through a turbine which generates electricity on the same principle as
electricity from wind projects where wind is utilized to turn the turbine to produce electricity.
Therefore, there is no rationale for levy of "water cess" or "air cess".
(viii) The levy of water cess is against the provisions of the Constitution. Entry-17 of List-II, does not
authorize the State to levy any tax or duty on water.
2. In light of the above constitutional provisions, no taxes/duties may be levied by any State under
any guise on generation of electricity and if any taxes / duties have been so levied, it may be
promptly This has the approval of the Hon'ble Union Minister of Power and New & Renewable
Energy".
.
5.8. It is next urged by the learned Senior Counsel that before executing the projects, the projects
have entered into power purchase agreements (PPAs), under which they are otherwise obliged to
give 12% electricity free of cost to the State Government and 1% towards rehabilitation making them
liable to give 13% of the electricity so generated free of cost to the State Government, therefore, the
State Government is estopped from levying such tax.
Arguments of Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi, learned Senior Advocate for some of the petitioners:
6.1. Learned Senior Advocate, apart from endorsing the arguments as addressed by Mr. Mehta,
learned Senior Advocate, would argue that the State has no source of power to enact the 'Act' and in
terms of article 265, there can be no taxation without authority. He would further urge that taxation
cannot be general but has to be under a specific entry under the Constitution of India and the
enactment i.e., the impugned Act, in pith and substance, is a tax on 'generation of electricity' and not
on 'drawl of water' and the enactment otherwise defies the very federal concept and structure of our
Constitution and thus is liable to be struck down. He has also referred to the 'objects and reasons' of
the 'Act' and would argue that even financial demands of the State have to be .
legitimate.

7.1. Learned Attorney General has contested the claim of the State in enacting the Act and apart
from relying upon the reply filed on behalf of the Union of India has sought to draw support from
the notification dated 16.02.2023 issued by the Ministry of Power, Government of India (as
extracted above).
7.2. In addition thereto, he would argue that the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India
provides for the substantive Regulatory Law and the taxing power separately.
Taxing power can otherwise not be inferred much less imposed by implication. In particular, he has
invited the attention of the Court to entry No. 17 of list-II to urge that this entry only regulates the
power of the State Government with respect to water and not to impose tax thereupon. Entry No. 17
cannot be read expansively so as to include power to impose tax.
7.3. He then invited our attention to entry No. 53 of the same list i.e., List No.II to contend that both
the aforesaid entries i.e., entries No. 17 and 53 have to be read independently and an equitable
construction is not permissible in a taxing statute. Moreover, the tax even .
otherwise can be imposed by the State Government within confines of the State. Even as per entry
No. 53 of List -II "sale of electricity" as envisaged thereunder cannot mean and be construed as
generation of electricity. Like sale of coal will not include generation of electricity out of the use of
coal.
Arguments of Mr. Surjit Ghosh, Advocate:
8.1. Shri Surjit Ghosh, Advocate, apart from adopting the arguments of both the aforesaid learned
Senior Counsel(s), has assailed the provisions of the Act as being unconstitutional by referring to
Section 15 urging that since this provision of law delegates the power to determine the rate of tax to
the State Government without laying down any guidelines, limitation or safeguards, therefore, such
legislative architecture suffers from the vice of excessive delegation and is thereby violative of Article
14 and is plainly void.
8.2. He further argues that the impugned Act fails to clearly lay down one of the critical components
of taxing statute i.e. measure of tax and it is trite in law that in order to levy a tax so as to make both
operative and valid, four essential components must be provided in the enacting statute creating the
tax/impost, i.e.:
(i) the taxable event attracting the levy;
.
(ii) the person on whom the levy is imposed and who is obliged to pay the tax;

17Cwp No. 2916/2023 vs State Of H.P. & Ors on 5 March, 2024
(iii) the rate at which the tax is imposed; and
(iv) the measure or value to which the rate will be applied for computing the tax liability.
Whereas in the instant cases, though three of essential components can be identified within the
statute i.e. "taxable event", "the person liable to pay tax", and the "rate of tax", however, the
impugned Act fails to identify the value and equally critical component i.e. "measure of tax" which is
the value on which the rate of tax will be applied for computing the taxing liability. Section 15 of the
Act though provides that the 'user' shall be liable to pay the water cess at such rates as fixed by the
Government, however, it fails to prescribe the value or base on which such rate will be applied.
8.3. He also argues that adjudication of disputes fails to contemplate an opportunity of personal
hearing thereby being in violation of the principles of natural justice and thus ultra vires of Article
14.
8.4. He would further contend that Section 30 of the impugned Act is in contradiction to Section 28
of the Act and is, therefore, bad in law.
.
8.5. Lastly, he would contend that absence of judicial member in quasi-judicial proceedings renders
such quasi-
judicial proceedings bad in law.
Arguments of Mr. Naresh K. Sood, Senior Advocate:
9.1. Learned counsel for the petitioner(s) in CWP Nos.
2864/2023 and 3410/2023, apart from adopting the arguments of all the aforesaid learned
counsel(s), would argue that his client i.e. Bhakhra Beas Management Board, is a creation of the
statute after coming into force the Punjab Re-organization Act and has also preferred a
representation against the impugned levy and till and so long the said representation is not decided,
the State cannot levy any cess.
Arguments of Mr. Anand Sharma, Senior Advocate:
10.1. Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner urged to contend that the respondents had no power
to impose cess on the project i.e. Shanan Power Project, as the same came into existence and is
operating for nearly a century now.
Arguments of Mr. K.D. Shreedhar and Mr. Rajnish Maniktala, Senior Advocates:
11.1. Learned Senior Counsels for the petitioners have .
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193385936/
18Cwp No. 2916/2023 vs State Of H.P. & Ors on 5 March, 2024
fully supported the arguments of other learned Senior Counsels appearing for the petitioner(s) and
have also addressed independent arguments assailing the competence of the State to enact the
impugned Act. They have vehemently urged that the cess has not been imposed on the 'water
drawn', but the same has been imposed on the 'generation of electricity' and before amendment of
Entry-84 of List I of the Seventh Schedule, in the year 2016, 'electricity' was specifically held to be
goods within the meaning of Entry-84 and consequently, it was only the Parliament, which could
levy tax on generation of electricity. After the amendment of Entry-
84, now the generation of electricity can only be taxed under Entry-97 i.e. conferring residual
powers upon the Parliament under List I of Seventh Schedule and in order to buttress their
arguments, they have placed strong reliance on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in M.P.
Cement Manufacturers Association vs. State of Madhya Pradesh2 which judgment (2004) 2 SCC
249 in turn has been followed by the High Court of Jammu and Kashmir in National Hydroelectric
Power Corporation Limited vs. State of Jammu and Kashmir3 and by the .
Guahati High Court in Bharti Airtel Limited vs. State of Assam4.
Arguments of Dr. Seema Jain, Advocate:
12.1. Learned counsel for the petitioner, apart from adopting the arguments of all the aforesaid
counsel(s) for the petitioner(s), has separately addressed the arguments to contend that the State
has no legislative competence to enact the law as there is no entry in the State List which may
empower the State to impose a tax/cess on generation of electricity.
Arguments of Mr.Tarun Johri, Advocate:
13.1. In addition to adopting the arguments of the aforesaid learned counsel(s) for the petitioner(s),
he would argue that since his client is an association of Small Hydro Power Developers, who have
installed various projects with the capacity of 25 MW, the financial impact on substantial members
of the petitioner due to levy of water cess under the said Act is approximately on an average 43% of
total revenue 2005 (2) JKJ 5 2016 (4) Guahati Law Times 781 earned by such projects in a financial
year, therefore, it would not only put his client in financial distress, but the State otherwise is
estopped from enacting and implementing the .
impugned legislation.
14.1. All the other learned counsels appearing for the petitioners have adopted the aforesaid
arguments and have also separately argued, but the same being only repetitive, need not be referred
to.
Arguments of Learned Advocate General on behalf of State of Himachal Pradesh:
15.1. The learned Advocate General has sought to draw support to levy of water cess on the ground
that the object of the Act is to conserve the water and its management as well as to generate revenue
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193385936/
19Cwp No. 2916/2023 vs State Of H.P. & Ors on 5 March, 2024
from alternate revenue resources as set out in the object of the Act.
15.2. He would contend that the petitioners are unnecessarily trying to confuse the issue by arguing
that the cess has been imposed on generation of electricity and not the water drawn by their projects
for non consumptive use of water. He has taken us through the provisions of the Act, more
particularly, provisions those contained in Sections 2(c), 2(g), 2(h), 2(i), 2(j), 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 and 12
thereof. He is at pains to argue that the petitioners are liable to pay cess on the 'water drawn' being
its users.
15.3. Additionally, he would argue that the State .
Government has, in its reply, specifically clarified that it has imposed cess on 'water drawn' for 'use
of hydropower generation'. The cess is levied under List-II of Seventh Schedule. It is the case of the
State that entries No. 17 and 18 are general entries qua field of legislation of the Legislative
Assembly of the State. Entries 45 to 50 provide for field of legislation for imposing cess/tax,
whereas, entry No. 66 deals with fee.
15.4. The State has submitted the following points for the Court's consideration.
1. The presumption of constitutionality is in favour of the statute.
2. Entries in the list being fields of legislation must receive liberal construction.
3. The impugned Act is within the purview of entry 49 'Lands and Buildings' of List II as water is
covered under entry "land" being in and over the land.
4. The Act also falls within purview of entry 50 of List II, as the water is mineral and the State has
right over the water flowing or .
stored within its jurisdiction, which right includes right to tax or impose tax.
5. The water being in and over the land, the income/revenue generated from water is the land
revenue of the State under entry 45 of List II.
6. The mode of calculation will not determine the nature of the cess.
7. There are no structural defects qua delegation of power etc in statute so as to declare the Act as
ultra vires to its provisions/constitution of India.
8. Lastly, the public interest would prevail over the private/individual interest.
Arguments of Mr. Dushyant Dave, learned Senior Advocate on behalf of the State of Himachal
Pradesh:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193385936/
20Cwp No. 2916/2023 vs State Of H.P. & Ors on 5 March, 2024
16.1. On 13.12.2023, Mr. Dushyant Dave, learned Senior Advocate, appeared on
behalf of the State and made additional arguments that:
(1) Even as per the pleadings of the petitioner(s), the water being consumed for
generation of electricity belongs to the State of Himachal .
Pradesh and the fact that the water belongs to the State and the consumption of water is in
Himachal Pradesh has been unequivocally acknowledged by them. They have further claimed an
unfettered right of use of water for the purpose of tapping the potential for generating hydro energy
as stored in the river water.
(2) The State is not denying the petitioner(s) or any one of them from using water and since the
water falls in the List-II of the Seventh Schedule, the State is well within its power to levy fee, cess or
tax, as the case may, on such water or even its non-consumptive use as the water originate from the
land. He also invited our attention to Sections 3 and 10 of the impugned Act to convince that the
cess is on the "water drawn and not generation of electricity", and this, in fact, is the pith and
substance of the entire Act.
(3) Once it is established on record that the .
impugned Act is a valid piece of legislation, then all the other prayers whereby the petitioners have
sought a declaration that the impugned Act is beyond the legislative competence of the State in
terms of Articles 245 and 246 of the Constitution, would fall like a pack of cards.
(4) The Act is neither retrospective nor retro-
active and, therefore, the provisions of the Act have been made applicable to the existing projects
sought to be declared unconstitutional, quashed and set aside, is clearly fallacious as the Act is
prospective.
(5) Under Articles 245 and 246 of the Constitution, in particular, sub Article (3) of Article 246, the
State has exclusive power to frame laws as regards List II of the Seventh Schedule i.e. State List and
such entry must receive the widest interpretation. The State not only enjoys the exclusive power but
also ancillary power under Entry 17, List II, which deals with land and nowhere impinges upon .
or touches Entry 56 of List-I i.e. Union List, as the tax is confined, as it does not deal with inter-State
regulations, and such Act is confined to Himachal Pradesh only.
(6) The Parliament has not enacted any law prohibiting the State from using water.
(7) He then referred to List-II, Entry 18, to contend that land includes water on its sub-
terrain or under land.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193385936/
21Cwp No. 2916/2023 vs State Of H.P. & Ors on 5 March, 2024
(8) He also referred to Entry 49, which empowers the State to impose tax on land and building i.e.
land and anything connected to the land, which according to him, is the plenary power of the State
Legislature.
(9) The Act stands no judicial scrutiny, as even Entry 66 which deals with fees could be invoked by
the State as cess can be taxed as also a fee and going by the latest trend in law, even for a fee, there is
no co-relationship required to be established.
(10) He thereafter invited our attention to the .
reply filed on behalf of the State to contend that the resources of the State are very limited because
the State has its natural limitation, therefore, the State must be allowed to exploit its natural
resources, for which the State not only has the constitutional powers but also has a duty to exploit
water resources. Any other interpretation would be a narrow interpretation.
(11) According to him, the people of the State are the stakeholders and shareholders of the natural
resources and the impugned legislation is of a paramount public importance.
(12) The mere fact that the hydropower would become more expensive, is no ground to test its
constitutional validity, more particularly, when the rise in power would be passed on to the
consumers.
(13) It is more than settled that the financial .
burden would be of no excuse much less a ground to strike down a valid piece of legislation.
(14) The Constitution framers gave two rights to the State, i.e. one under Article 45 of the
Constitution; to levy revenue and other under Article 49 of the Constitution; to impose tax on land,
and thereafter vide Entry 50 confers right on the State to levy tax on mineral rights subject to the
limitation imposed by the Parliament by law relating to mineral development. The Mines and
Minerals Act does not impose any restrictions on the use of minerals and water being a mineral is in
the exclusive legislative domain of the State Government. Furthermore, Section 2 of the Mines and
Minerals Act does not impose any restrictions on State Government to levy tax on minerals.
(15) If there is a power under the Constitution, it could be traced under any of the Entries, given the
fact that the land cannot be .
interpreted in any narrow and pedantic sense. The impugned piece of legislation is referable to
Entries 17, 18, 45, 49, 50 and 60 and does not suffer from any constitutional vice.
(16) The petitioner in one of the cases i.e. NHPC made a profit of more than Rs. 3,000 crores and
even other projects are earning hundreds of crores and, therefore, has no occasion to complain.

22Cwp No. 2916/2023 vs State Of H.P. & Ors on 5 March, 2024
(17) After the imposition of General Sales Tax (GST), the State must have complete power to
augment its resources and generate its income and any narrow interpretation will hit at the federal
structure.
(18) The petitioners cannot complain that they will not participate in the progress of the State by
making the State prosperous and will have to pay tax, which has been levied strictly in accordance
with law.
16.2. Mr. Dave, in support of his contention, urged that .
the 'land' cannot be interpreted in a narrow and pedantic sense and referred to the following
judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court:-
1. Navinchandra Mafatlal vs. The Commissioner of Income Tax, Bombay City, 1955

levy tax on the water drawn and consumed and in support of such contention, placed reliance on the
judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Khyerbari Tea Co. Ltd. & Anr. vs. The State of Assam5.
16.4. He would then contend that legislature can levy tax and then prescribe machinery for the
same. The tax collected from the producers does not mean that it is a tax on producers and for this
purpose has placed reliance on the Judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in The Anant Mills Co.
Ltd. vs. State of Gujarat and Ors6, The Government of Andhra Paradesh and Anr. vs. Hindustan
Machine Tools Ltd.7 and M/s Hoechst Pharmaceuticals Ltd. & Ors. vs. State of Bihar & Ors.8 16.5.
He relied upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Ichchapur Industrial Coop. Society
Ltd.
1964 (5) SCR 975.
1975 (2) SCC 175.
1975 (2) SCC 274.
1983 (4) SCC 45.
vs. Competent Authority, ONGC and Anr.9 to canvass that 'water' is a 'mineral' and it was so held by
the Hon'ble Supreme Court.
.
16.6. According to Mr. Dave, the issue in question as to whether land includes water has been
authoritatively decided by three-judge Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in R. S. Rekhchand
Mohota Spinning & Weaving Mills Ltd. vs. State of Maharashtra,10 and such tax could be recovered
as arrears of the land revenue under Entry 45 and in support of such contention strong reliance has
been placed upon Sections 42, 43, 44, 63(1)(d)(e) and Section 103 of the H.P. Land Revenue Act.
According to Mr. Dave, the cess is on water and generation of electricity is only a measure.
16.7. He further relied upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in State of W. B. vs.
Kesoram Industries Ltd. & Ors.11 to canvass that mere fact that the tax would be a burden on the
consumer, is no ground to assail the same.
16.8. He would further argue that while interpreting the provisions of the Act, the federal structure
is required to be borne in mind. The financial independence of a State is as important as its political
independence or it will lose its 1997 (2) SCC 42 1997 (6) SCC 12 2004 (10) SCC 201 independence.
In support of such contention, reliance is placed on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
Government (NCT of Delhi) vs. Union of India & Anr.12.

24Cwp No. 2916/2023 vs State Of H.P. & Ors on 5 March, 2024
17. Before giving point-wise findings to the four questions raised in these petitions, the well settled
proposition of interpretation of law which will be necessary while examining the statute needs to be
noticed.
Interpretation of Law:
18. A Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Navinchandra Mafatlal vs. The
Commissioner of Income Tax, Bombay City13 after placing reliance on the observations made by the
then Chief Justice Gwyer in The United Provinces vs. Atiqa Begum14 held that the entries in the
Seventh Schedule of the Constitution should not be read in a narrow or restricted sense and that
each general word should be held to extend to all ancillary or subsidiary matters which can fairly
and reasonably be said to be comprehended in it. While construing an entry, the widest possible
construction according to the ordinary meaning must be put upon the words used therein. The
cardinal rule of interpretation, however, is that 2018 (8) SCC 501 1955 (1) SCR 829 1940 F.C.R. 110
words should be read in their ordinary, natural and grammatical meaning subject to this rider that
in construing words in a constitutional enactment conferring legislative power .
the most liberal construction should be put to the words so that the same may have effect in their
widest amplitude.
19. In Calcutta Gas Co.( (Proprietary) Ltd. vs. State of W.B.15 the Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court observed that it may now be taken as well settled that every attempt should be made
to harmonize the apparently conflicting entries not only of different Lists but also of the same List
and to reject that construction which will rob one of the entries of its entire content and make it
nugatory.
20. In Raja Jagannath Baksh Singh vs. State of U.P.16, the Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court held that while interpreting the words used in the Constitution, it is an elementary
cardinal rule of interpretation that the words used in the Constitution which confer legislative power
must receive the most liberal construction and if they are the words of wide amplitude, they must be
interpreted so as to give effect to that amplitude. It would be out of place to put a narrow or
restricted construction on words of wide amplitude in a 1962 Supp. (3) SCR 1 (1963) 1 SCR 220
Constitution. A general word used in an entry must be construed to extend to all ancillary or
subsidiary matters which can fairly and reasonably be held to be included in it.
.
21. In Khyebari Tea Co. vs. State of Assam17, a Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court
held that it is well settled that when a power is conferred on the Legislature to levy a tax, that power
must itself widely be construed; it must include the power to impose a tax and select the articles,
commodities for the exercise of such power and must likewise include the power to fix the rate and
prescribe the machinery for the recovery of the tax. This power also gives jurisdiction to the
legislature to make such provisions as, in its opinion, would be necessary to prevent the evasion of
tax.

25Cwp No. 2916/2023 vs State Of H.P. & Ors on 5 March, 2024
Point No. 1:
Nature and event of taxation under the impugned Act:
22. In order to appreciate the rival contentions, it would first be necessary to consider the nature
and event of taxation under the impugned Act.
23. The Statement of Objects and Reasons read as under:-
"STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS (1964) 5 SCR 975 Himachal Pradesh
has been blessed with the immense water resources of five major rivers Satluj, Beas,
Ravi, Chenab and Yamuna. These rivers are endowed with immense water flow
throughout the year which is being .
used for generation of hydropower. Further, for proper water conservation and water management,
the State is spending huge amount of money on environment and social impact mitigation. The
developmental activities in the vicinity of hydropower projects are increasing livelihood of the
concerned people. Considerable potential has not been considered on hydropower development on
this account of environmental and social aspects.
The State of Himachal Pradesh has very limited revenue generation resources and there always
remain financial constraints in the State. Hence, there is an urgent need to improve the revenue
generation in the State through alternate revenue resources. Flowing water in various rivers and its
tributaries in the State can be useful source of revenue generation. The neighbouring State
Uttrakhand and the Union Territory Jammu & Kashmir have already imposed the water cess on
hydropower generation. On the same analogy the State Government has decided to introduce such
policy and also opt to impose the water cess to increase the revenue of the State.
The water cess on hydropower generation will be imposed based on consumption of water and head
available in the project, which is considered difference in the level at entry and exit of water
conductor system. At present 172 hydropower projects, with installed capacity of 10,991 MW, have
been commissioned in the State. In order to deal with the situation of serious financial constraints in
the State, it has been decided to make the provision to create additional financial resources by
imposing water cess on hydropower generation.
.
Since, the Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly was not in session and the issue to create
alternate revenue resources of the State could not be prolonged, hence, keeping in view of the
urgency and importance of the matter, the Governor, Himachal Pradesh, by invoking powers under
clause (1) of article 213 of the Constitution of India promulgated the Himachal Pradesh Water Cess
on Hydropower Generation Ordinance, 2023 (Ordinance No. 2 of 2023) on 15.02.2023 which was
published in Rajpatra (e-Gazette) r on the same day. Now, this Ordinance is required to be replaced
by a regular enactment. This Bill seeks to replace the aforesaid ordinance with some modifications.

rates as the Government may, by notification fix in this behalf. (2) The State
Government may review, increase, decrease or vary the rates of the water cess fixed
under this section from time to time in the manner it deems fit."
31. The procedure for assessment has been provided in Section 17 which reads as under:
"17. Procedure for assessment.--(1) The assessment of water drawn by the user for
hydropower generation and computation of water cess thereof, shall be carried out by
the Commission.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193385936/
28Cwp No. 2916/2023 vs State Of H.P. & Ors on 5 March, 2024
(2) The user shall pay the water cess as assessed under sub-section (1) within such
time as may be specified by the Commission.
(3) If any user fails to pay water cess due on him, .
penalty shall be imposed on the user as determined by the Commission. The user has to pay water
cess along with penalty within extended time as may be prescribed."
32. It would be noticed that in the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the impugned Act, it was
stated that "the State Government has decided to introduce such policy and also opt to impose water
cess to increase the revenue of the State. The water cess on hydropower generation will be imposed
based on consumption of water and head available in the project, which is considered difference in
level at entry and exit of water conductor system".
33. As per Section 10(i) of the Act every registered user is liable to pay water cess for the water
drawn for hydropower generation. As per Section 12, the Commission shall install flow measuring
devices within the premises of the scheme or may adopt any other indirect method for assessment of
water drawn by the user.
34. As per Section 15, the "user" is liable to pay water cess at such rates that have been fixed by the
Government as per the Notification and Section 16 provides for its recovery.
Under Section 17 based on such assessment of water drawn by the user, computation on water cess
is carried out.
.
35. It is more than settled that taxation under the List to the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution
may with respect to an object or an event or may be with respect to both.
36. From the Preamble as also the various provisions of the impugned Act extracted above, it would
be evidently clear that the impugned levy has not been imposed on "water" but on a single
inextricable event that is "water drawn for hydropower generation".
37. Why we observe so is because there can be no electricity generation by a hydropower project
without drawl of water. In absence of generation of electricity, no levy/cess is imposed.
38. What would further be noticed from the impugned Act is that it maintains complete silence on
the measure of levy.
39. The tariff of the water cess has been set out in the notification dated 16.02.2023, which is
extracted below:

40. It is clearly evident from the aforesaid Notification that the State Government has calibrated the
cess keeping in view potentiality of the water i.e. the greater the height from which the water falls on
the turbine, the greater the momentum resulting in electromagnetic field causing the generation of
electricity. Therefore, it is not essentially the quantum of water but rather it is the head-height,
which has been taken into consideration by the State while fixing the rate of levy.
41. In other words, the power to tax is on generation of electricity and user of water is only
incidental. The "user of water" is not being taxed and it is only the "user of water for .
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193385936/
30Cwp No. 2916/2023 vs State Of H.P. & Ors on 5 March, 2024
generation of electricity", who is being taxed. Therefore, it is a tax on generation of electricity. If it
was the quantum of water used, then the height from which the water would fall as a measure to
determine the rate of cess would be wholly irrelevant. It is evidently clear from the aforesaid
notification dated 16.02.2023 that the quantification is not based on the use of water, but is based
on the height from which the water falls. The "use of water" in fact does not go by the text of the
impugned Act. It is "generation of electricity" that is the "bone"
and "water drawn" is only the "flesh". The taxable event is "hydropower generation" and not the
"usage of water" because if there is no generation, then there is no "tax". Moreover, if the cess was
on "usage of water", then how could the height, at which the water falls on the turbine, be made the
taxable event?
42. It is settled principle of law that standard adopted as a measure of levy, although not
determinative, is at least indicative of the nature of the tax. Weighed alongwith and in the light of
other relevant circumstances, the method adopted by the legislature would be relevant in
determining the character of the impost. To be regarded as valid basis, the measure of the levy must
maintain a nexus with the essential character, as held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in State of
West Bengal v.
.
Kesoram Industries Ltd.18. It shall be relevant to extract the relevant observations as contained in
paras 33 and 38, which read as under:-
"We now proceed to enter a deeper dimension in the field of tax legislation by
considering the problem of devising the measure of taxation. This aspect has been
dealt with in detail in Union of India and Ors. v. Bombay Tyre International Ltd.,.
Tracing the principles from the leading authority of Re.: a reference under the
Government of Ireland Act 1920 and Section 3 of the Finance Act (Northern Ireland)
1934, (1936) A.C. 352, passing through Ralla Ram v. Province of East Punjab, 1948
FCR 207, and treading through the law as it has developed through judicial
pronouncements one after the ether, this Court has made subtle observations therein.
It has been long recognized that the measure employed for assessing a tax must not
be confused with the nature of the tax. A tax has two elements: first, the person, thing
or activity on which the tax is imposed, and secondly, the amount of tax. The amount
may be measured in many ways; but a distinction between the subject matter of a tax
and the standard by which the amount of tax is measured must not be lost sight of.
These are described respectively as the subject of a tax and the measure of a tax. It is
true that the standard adopted as a measure of the levy may 18 (2004) 10 SCC 201 be
indicative of the nature of the tax, but it does not necessarily determine it. The nature
of the mechanism by which the tax is to be assessed is not decisive of the essential
characteristic of the particular tax charged, .
though it may throw light on the general character of the tax.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193385936/
31Cwp No. 2916/2023 vs State Of H.P. & Ors on 5 March, 2024
38. In the Hingir-Rampur Coal Co. Ltd. v. State of Orissa, (1961) 2 (SCR) 537, the
form in which the levy was imposed was held to be an impermissible test for defining
in itself the character of the levy. It was argued that the method of determining the
rate of levy was by reference to the minerals produced by the mines and, therefore, it
was levy in the nature of a duty of excise. This Court held that the method thus
adopted may be relevant in considering the character of the impost but its effect must
be weighed alongwith and in the light of the other relevant circumstances. Referring
to Bombay Tyre International Ltd. (supra), the Court further held that it is clear that
when enacting a measure to serve as a standard for assessing the levy, the Legislature
need not contour it along lines which spell out the character of the levy itself. A
broader based standard of reference is permissible to be adopted for the purpose of
determining the measure of the levy. Any standard which maintains a nexus with the
essential character of the levy can be regarded as a valid basis for assessing the
measure of the levy."
43. Applying the aforesaid principles to the instant cases, it would be evident that the impugned levy
varies in quantum with the quantum of electricity generated but not the quantum of water drawn
and, thus, makes it clear that its character or nature is such that it is inextricable with electricity
generation. Thus, we have no hesitation to answer Point No. 1 .
in favour of the petitioners by concluding that by the impugned Act cess is sought to be imposed on
"generation of electricity" as against "water" and, therefore, it is a misnomer that tax is levied on
"water" and not "generation of electricity", and is, therefore, not a water tax.
This point is answered accordingly in favour of the petitioners.
Point No. 2.
44. At the outset, it is necessary to observe that normally it is the 'pith and substance' of the taxing
legislation which assumes significance not to the question of bonafides or malafides but in
examining the competence of the legislature because the State, while promulgating a statute, might
purport to act within limits of its powers, yet in substance and in reality, it may be transgressing
these powers, the transgression being veiled by what appears, on proper examination, to be a mere
pretense or a disguise.
Pith and Substance
45. In determining whether an enactment is a legislation with respect to the given power, what is
relevant is .
whether in its "pith and substance", it is law upon the subject matter in question. Therefore, it is
necessary here to subject the impugned Act to the test of "pith and substance" to ascertain its true
intent and character, which is relevant in determining as to which list it would fall under and also to
trace the State's competence to have promulgated the impugned Act arises. As per Article 265, no
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193385936/
32Cwp No. 2916/2023 vs State Of H.P. & Ors on 5 March, 2024
tax can be levied or collected except by authority of law.
Competence of the State to promulgate the impugned Act whether can be traced to Entry 49 of
List-II to the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution as contended by the State:
46. Entry 49 of List II (State List) provides for "Taxes on lands and buildings."
47. The State has relied on Anant Mills Co. Ltd. vs. State of Gurajat & others19, in the said case the
question was with regard to assessment of property tax of large premises like textile mills and
factories. The property tax, in that context, comprised (a) water tax, (b) conservancy tax, and (c) a
general tax. It was argued in that case that the State legislature has no 19 (1975) 2 SCC 175
competence under Entry 49 of List-II to enact a law for levying tax in respect of an area occupied by
underground supply line.
It was argued that the word land denotes the surface of land .
and not the underground strata. Rejecting the arguments, the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed that
the word "land" includes not only the face of earth but everything under or over it and has in its legal
significance an indefinite extent upwards and downwards giving rise to the maxim: eujus est sulum,
ejus est usque ad column. Further, twin conditions to qualify a levy as tax on lands and buildings
i.e.:
(i) Tax is directly imposed on lands and buildings;
and
(ii) Tax bears a definite relation to land were specified.
48. However, we find that State's competence to levy tax on water drawn for hydropower generation
in the instant case cannot be traced to Entry 49 of List-II, as the impugned levy does not satisfy the
above mentioned twin conditions. The levy of tax on water drawn for hydropower generation is
definitely not a tax, which is directly on lands and buildings i.e. the land on which the hydropower
plant is situated or the power generating units. Rather, as evidenced by the impugned Act itself, it is
a tax on a "user" and is levied pursuant to occurrence of an event/activity i.e. "for water drawn for
hydropower generation", which cannot be regarded as having any relation to land, much less a
definite one.
.
49. Furthermore, as prescribed by the charging section i.e. Section 15 of the impugned Act, it is
indicative that tax is on the registered user i.e. it is personal. Under Section 2(g) of the impugned
Act, "user" is defined to mean "any person, group of persons, local body, government department,
company, corporation, society or anybody, by whichever name called drawing water from any source
for generation of hydropower".
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193385936/
33Cwp No. 2916/2023 vs State Of H.P. & Ors on 5 March, 2024
Therefore, the tax is on persons (whether natural or juristic) and not on lands or buildings as units.
Therefore, in such circumstances, the reliance placed by the State on the judgment in Anant Mills
(supra) is clearly misplaced.
50. Even otherwise the expression "Land" cannot be logically interpreted to mean everything above
and below it, as that would cover everything on the earth and subsume all other Entries in Seventh
Schedule, as there are Entries in List-I and List-II, dealing with the subject on, above or below land.
Some of the entries in List-I, which are connected to the land and buildings and which will be
rendered otiose by the State Government wide interpretation are:
(i) Entry 7. Industries declared by Parliament by law to be necessary for the purpose
of defence or for the prosecution of war .
(ii) Entry 22. Railways.
(iii) Entry 23. Highways declared by or under law made by Parliament to be national
highways.
iv. Entry 24. Shipping and navigation on inland waterways, declared by Parliament by way to be
national waterways, as regards mechanically propelled vessels; the rule of the road on such water

v. Entry 26. Lighthouses, including lightships, beacons and other provision for the safety of shipping

vi. Entry 29. Airways; aircraft and air navigation;
provision of aerodromes; regulation and organization of air traffic and of aerodromes;
provision for aeronautical education and training and regulation of such education and training
provided by States and other agencies.
vii. Entry 53. Regulation and development of oilfields and mineral oil resources; petroleum and
petroleum products; other liquids and substances declared by Parliament by law to be dangerously
inflammable.
viii. Entry 87. Estate duty in respect of property .
other than agricultural land.
ix. Entry 88. Duties in respect of succession to property other than agricultural land.
x. Entry 89. Terminal taxes on goods or passengers, carried by railway, sea or air; taxes on railway

51. It is well settled that while the widest amplitude should be given to the language used in one
entry, every attempt has to be made to harmonise its contents with those of other entries, so that the
latter may not be rendered nugatory.
52. In this regard, reliance can be placed on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Calcutta
Gas Company (Proprietary) Ltd. vs. State of West Bengal and others20 , the relevant portion
whereof reads as under:
"8......Before construing the said entries it would be useful to' notice some of the well
settled rules of interpretation laid down by the Federal Court and this Court in the
matter of construing the entries. The power to legislate is given to the appropriate
Legislatures by Art. 246 of the Constitution. The entries in the three Lists are AIR
1962 SC 1044 only legislative heads or fields of legislation : they demarcate the area
over which the appropriate Legislatures can operate. It is also well settled that widest
amplitude should be given to the language of the entries.
.
But some of the entries in the different List or in the same List may overlap and
sometimes may also appear to be in direct conflict with each other. It is then the duty
of this Court to reconcile the entries and bring about harmony between them....."
53. In Rajendra Diwan vs. Pradeep Kumar Ranibala and Another21, the Hon'ble Supreme Court
held as under:-
"50. While the widest amplitude should be given to the language used in one entry,
every attempt has to be made to harmonise its contents with those of other entries, so
that the latter may not be rendered nugatory."
Competence to promulgate the impugned Act whether can be traced to Entry 50 of List-II as
contended by the State:
54. Entry 50 of List-II (State List) provides for "Taxes on mineral rights subject to any limitations
imposed by Parliament by law relating to mineral development."
55. The State's competence to impose impugned levy cannot be traced to Entry 50 of List-II as
contended by it.
Activity of non-consumptive drawl of water for generation of hydropower, where the water drawn is
allowed to flow back to (2019) 20 SCC 143 its source, being a single inextricable event cannot be
brought under the purview of taxing mineral rights.
56. The State has placed reliance on the judgment of the .
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193385936/
35Cwp No. 2916/2023 vs State Of H.P. & Ors on 5 March, 2024
Hon'ble Supreme Court in Ichchapur Industrial Coop. Society Ltd. vs. Competent Authority, Oil &
Natural Gas Commission22, to contend that water is a mineral, therefore, the rights in such mineral
can be taxed by it.
57. Adverting to Ichchapur's case (supra), it needs to be noticed that Hon'ble Supreme Court
clarified that the term "Minerals" was being interpreted for the purposes of Petroleum & Minerals
Pipelines (Acquisition of Right of User in Land) Act, 1962 (User Rights Acquisition Act) only
considering the definition of the terms under the Mines Act, 1952. Further, the Hon'ble Supreme
Court held that the User Rights Acquisition Act utilizes the device "Legislation by reference or
incorporation", whereby the definition of Minerals" under Mines Act, 1952 could be deemed to have
been bodily lifted and incorporated in the later act i.e., User Rights Acquisition Act (supra).
However, the same ratio cannot be applied to the instant cases to hold that there is legislation by
reference or incorporation under List-II of the Constitution insofar as definition of the term
"Minerals" contained under Mines Act, 22 (1997) 2 SCC 42 1952 is concerned. The Mines Act, 1952
was promulgated subsequent to the Constitution and the former cannot be interpreted with
reference to definition clauses set out under .
the latter. Moreover, it is trite in law that judgments cannot be applied without appreciating their
contest particularly, judgments must be read as whole, and the observations are to be considered in
light of the questions which were before the Court leading up to the judgment as the decision takes
its colour from the questions involved in a case in which it is rendered. (See: Haryana Financial
Corporation and Anr. Vs. Jagdamba Oil Mills & Anr., (2002) 3 SCC 496, Paras 19 to 21, Hon'ble
three Judge Bench).
58. Therefore, the aforesaid judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Ichchapur's case (supra),
which considered the limited question as to whether water is mineral within the meaning of Mines
Act, 1952 read with Section 2(ba) of the User Rights Acquisition Act, cannot be read as laying down
a precedent for interpreting Entry 50 of List-II of Constitution of List-II. In fact, neither the
dictionary meaning of the word, nor the meaning judicially ascribed to a word (i.e., in unrelated
judgments), can be invoked while interpreting the entries under the lists to the Seventh Schedule to
the Constitution.
59. We may at this stage profitably refer to the observations of the Hon'ble Constitutional Bench of
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Godfrey Phillips India Ltd. & Anr. vs. State .
of U.P. & Ors.23, wherein it was observed as under:-
42. But theoretically 'luxuries' is capable of covering each of the several meanings
ascribed to the word. The question is how the word is to be construed in the
Constitutional entry. Neither the dictionary meaning nor the meaning ascribed to the
word judicially (for the reasons stated) resolve the ambiguity. The solution must be
found in the language of the Entry taking into consideration the Constitutional
scheme with regard to the imposition of taxes and the collection of revenues.

36Cwp No. 2916/2023 vs State Of H.P. & Ors on 5 March, 2024
60. In view of the above discussion, even Entry 50 of List-II cannot be held to countenance the
States' taxation on water drawl for generation of electricity.
Competence to promulgate whether can be traced to Entry 45 of List-II:
61. Entry 45 of List II (State List) provides for "Land revenue, including the
assessment and collection of revenue, the maintenance of land records, survey for
revenue purposes and records of rights and alienation of revenues".
62. In order to support its contention that the State has competence to enact the
impugned Act, strong reliance is 23 (2005) 2 SCC 515 placed on Entry 45 of List-II
and also the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in R.S. Rekchand Mohota Spg.
& Wvg.
Mills Ltd. vs. State of Maharashtra24.
.
63. Adverting to the facts of the aforesaid case, it was the the Government of Maharashtra that had
by way of resolution dated 05.06.1973 (Resolution) under Section 70 of the Maharashtra Land
Revenue Code, 1966 (Code) imposed water cess on use of flowing water from River 'Wana' for non-
agricultural purpose, specifically industrial purpose.
64. In order to better appreciate the aforesaid case vis-a-
vis, the facts and the law involved in the instant case, it would be necessary to have a comparative
analysis of the said case with the present case and the same is set out in a table below:-

65. Now, in case the aforesaid comparison is adverted to, it would be noticed that in
Rekchand case (supra), the levy was imposed on drawl of flowing water by artificial
contrivance for industrial purpose. The rates of such levy were specified under
Resolution. It was on account of the definition of land under the Transfer of Property
Act, 1882, which included right to water flowing therefrom, the said levy was
sustained by the Hon'ble Supreme Court under Entry 45, List-II.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193385936/

66. However, in the instant cases, the levy being imposed on electricity generation
and supply, which are inextricable parts of the single event which is taxed under the
Impugned Act i.e., "water drawn for hydropower generation", which the State is not
competent to do. It appears that the very definition of "water source" has been altered
to include generation of electricity because the tax is not being imposed merely on the
drawl of water but for the generation of electricity and the levy in turn is based, as is
evident from the quantum of levy, which is based on the head height and not on the
water .
drawn.
67. Further, a perusal of para 12 of Rekchand's case (supra), makes it clear that there are references
to other judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, which concern Entry 49 of List-II and specify the
twin conditions being:
(i) tax is directly imposed on land; and
(ii) nexus between the levy and the land to be satisfied in order to sustain a legislation
under Entry 49, List-II.
68. As already held above, the State's competence to promulgate the impugned Act cannot be traced
to Entry 49 of List-II. Therefore, Rekchand's case (supra) is not applicable in the present case and
the State's competence cannot be traced to Entry 45 of List-II.
Competence to promulgate whether can be traced to Entries 17 & 18 read with 66 of List-II as a
"tax":
69. Entries 17, 18 and 66 of List II (State List) provide as under:-
"17. Water, that is to say, water supplies, irrigation and canals, drainage and
embankments, water storage and water power subject to the provisions of entry 56 of
List I.
18. Land, that is to say, right in or over land, land tenures including the relation of
landlord and tenant, .
and the collection of rents; transfer and alienation of agricultural land; land
improvement and agricultural loans; colonization.
66. Fee in respect of any of the matters in this List, but not including fees taken in
any court."
70. The State has relied on Entries 17 & 18 of List-II to demonstrate its competence to have
legislated the Impugned Act. In this regard, it is a settled principle of law that taxation entries are
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193385936/
40Cwp No. 2916/2023 vs State Of H.P. & Ors on 5 March, 2024
distinct from general regulatory entries. Entries 1 to 44 in List-II are regulatory, whereas Entries 45
to 63 are taxing entries. Therefore, the legislative competence to impose any tax on water drawn for
hydropower generation cannot be imposed by the State by referring to Entries 17 & 18 of List-II
being regulatory entry.
71. Reference in this regard can conveniently be made to the judgment rendered by the Hon'ble
Constitutional Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in M.P.V. Sundararamier & Co.

groups of Entries shows that while the main subject of legislation figures in the first group, a tax in
relation thereto is separately mentioned in the second. Thus, Entry 22 in List I is " Railways ", and
Entry 89 is "
Terminal taxes on goods or passengers, carried by railway, sea or air; taxes on railway
fares and freights ".
If Entry 22 is to be construed as involving taxes to be imposed, then Entry 89 would be superfluous.
Entry 41 mentions "Trade and commerce with foreign countries; import and export across customs
frontiers ". If these expressions are to be interpreted as including duties to be levied in respect of
that trade and commerce, then Entry 83 which is " Duties of customs including export duties "
would be wholly redundant. Entries 43 and 44 relate to incorporation, regulation and winding up of
corporations. Entry 85 provides separately for Corporation tax. Turning to List II, Entries I to 44
form one group mentioning the subjects on which the States could legislate. Entries 45 to 63 in that
List form another group, and they deal with taxes. Entry 18, for example, is " Land " and Entry 45 is
"Land revenue ". Entry 23 is "
Regulation of mines " and Entry 50 is " Taxes on mineral rights ". The above analysis-
and it is not exhaustive of the Entries in the Lists-leads to the inference that taxation
is not intended to be comprised in the main subject in which it might on an extended
construction be regarded as included, but is treated as a distinct matter for purposes
of legislative competence. And this distinction is also manifest in the language of Art.
248, Cls. (1) and (2), and of Entry 97 in List I of the Constitution. Construing Entry
42 in the light of the above scheme, it is difficult to resist the conclusion that .
the power of Parliament to legislate on inter-State trade and commerce under Entry
42 does not include a power to impose a tax on sales in the course of such trade and
commerce."

41Cwp No. 2916/2023 vs State Of H.P. & Ors on 5 March, 2024
72. Similar reiteration of law can be found in a three-
Judge Bench judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in M/s Hoechst Pharmaceuticals Ltd. & Ors.
vs. State of Bihar and Ors.26, wherein after following the judgment of the aforesaid Constitution
Bench, it was observed as under:-
"It would therefore appear that there is a distinction made between general subjects
of legislation and taxation. The general subjects of legislation are dealt with in one
group of entries and power of taxation ill a separate group. In M.P. Sundararamier &
Co. v. The State of Andhra Pradesh & Anr.(1) This Court dealt with the scheme of the
separation of taxation powers between the Union and the States by mutually
exclusive lists. In List I, Entries 1 to 81 deal with general subjects of legislation;
Entries 82 to 92A deal with taxes. In List 11, Entries 1 to 44 deal with general subjects
of legislation; Entries 45 to 63 deal With taxes. This mutual exclusiveness is also
brought out by the fact that in List Ill, the Concurrent Legislative List, there is no
entry relating to a tax, but it only contains an entry relating to levy of fees in respect
26 (1983) 4 SCC 45 of matters given in that list other than court-fees. Thus, in our
Constitution, a conflict of the taxing power of the Union and of the States cannot
arise. That being so, it is difficult to comprehend the submission that there can be .
intrusion by a law made by Parliament under Entry 33 of List III into a forbidden
field viz. the State s exclusive power to make a law with respect to the levy and
imposition of a tax on sale or purchase of goods relatable to Entry 54 of List II of the
Seventh Schedule. It follows that the two laws viz. sub-s. (3) of s. 5 of the Act and
paragraph 21 of the Control order issued by the Central Government under sub-s. (1)
of s. 3 of the Essential Commodities Act, operate on two separate and distinct fields
and both are capable of being obeyed.
There is no question of any clash between the two laws and the question of
repugnancy does not come into play."
73. In view of the above, considering the charging section, taxable event and nature of levying under
the impugned Act as well as subjecting the impugned Act to the test of "pith and substance", it is
absolutely clear that the impugned Act imposes tax on generation of electricity and not merely on
water as a subject or on drawl of water, which the State is not competent to do. It also imposes an
inter-State tax on inter-
State supply of electricity for which again the State is not competent to do so.
Competence to promulgate whether can be traced to Entries 17, 18 read with 66 of List II as a "fee":
74. It is also argued by the State in the alternative that .
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193385936/
42Cwp No. 2916/2023 vs State Of H.P. & Ors on 5 March, 2024
the impugned levy can be justified as a "Fee" on the basis of Entries 17 and 18 of read with Entry 66
of List-II. However, we find that the State lacks competence to levy the impugned cess as a fee. The
entire field of legislation concerning water power/hydropower projects, declared as such by
Parliament under the Electricity Act, 2003, is occupied by Parliament.
Therefore, the State lacks competence to levy any fee under the garb of water cess by relying upon
Entries 17 & 18, and 66 of List-II.
75. Even otherwise, it is settled that levy can assume the nature of "Fee", if there are any services
rendered by the State and, as such, there is quid pro quo, between the person paying fee and the
public authority which imposes it. Such quid pro quo, although not required to be established with
arithmetical exactitude, must at least be established broadly and reasonably with some amount of
certainty, reasonableness or preponderance of probability that quite a substantial portion of the fee
realised is spent for the benefit of the payers.
76. Moreover, a "Tax" recovered by a public authority goes into the consolidated fund, which is
ultimately utilised for all public purposes, whereas "Fee" is not intended to be, and does not become,
part of the consolidated fund. A "Fee" is earmarked and set apart for the purpose of services for
which it .
is levied.
77. The cess collected pursuant to the impugned Act does not get into a separate earmarked fund.
Moreover, while there was no services rendered by the State in the present case for the hydropower
plants and in addition thereto, the services claimed to be rendered by the State is incapable of being
distinguished from public service. Seen even from this perspective, the impugned levy cannot be
termed as "Fee".
78. The Scope of State's power to impose a tax on land has to be read in the context of Entry 18,
List-II which defines Land as "Land, that is to say, rights in or over land, land tenures including the
relation of landlord and tenant, and the collection of rents; transfer and alienation of agricultural
land;
land improvement and agricultural loans; colonization." This does not contemplate a river or
flowing water as a part of land.
Even the principle of leaning in favour of constitutionality of a provision will not be applicable as
there is patent lack of legislative competence.
79. The reliance of the State on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in State of West Bengal
vs. Kesoram Industries27 is entirely misplaced as the said judgment by .
Hon'ble five-Judge Constitution Bench, to the extent relied upon by the State, has not attained
finality, and has been referred to a Constitution Bench of Nine Hon'ble Judges of the Supreme
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193385936/
43Cwp No. 2916/2023 vs State Of H.P. & Ors on 5 March, 2024
Court.
80. Thus, once it is held that the cess sought to be imposed by the impugned Act is not on the "water
drawn" but on the "generation of electricity", then, it is the Central Government alone which could
levy tax on generation electricity.
81. In coming to such conclusion, we are duly supported by the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in M.P. Cement Manufacturer's case (supra), wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court was
examining Entry 84 of List I and Entry 53 of List II of the Seventh Schedule in the following
manner:-
"9. The two competing entries in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution are Entry
84 of List-I and Entry 53 of List- II. They respectively read:
List-I
84. Duties of excise on tobacco and other goods manufactured or produced in India
except-
27 (2004) 10 SCC 201
(a) alcoholic liquors for human consumption.
(b) (b) opium, Indian hemp and other narcotic drugs and narcotics, but including medicinal and
toilet preparations containing alcohol or any substance included in sub-
.
paragraph (b) of this entry.
List II
53. Taxes on the consumption or sale of electricity."
82. Noticing that electricity is goods (see CST vs. M.P. Electricity Board (1969) 1 SCC 200), the
Hon'ble Supreme Court observed that levy of State duty on production of electricity is covered with
the phrase "other goods manufactured" in Entry 84 of List I and this is within the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Parliament. Consequently, it was declared that the State has competence to levy
tax only on the sale and consumption of electricity (see Hoechst Pharmaceuticals Ltd. vs. State of
Bihar, (1983) 4 SCC 45).
Proceedings on this basis, the Hon'ble Supreme Court posed the question whether the State
Legislature was competent to levy cess on captive power generation, through amendment of the
Madhya Pradesh Upkar Adhiniyam, 1981. After a detailed discussion, the Hon'ble Supreme Court
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193385936/
44Cwp No. 2916/2023 vs State Of H.P. & Ors on 5 March, 2024
held that the levy on generation of electricity is not within the legislative competence of the State.
Point No. 2 is accordingly answered in favour of the petitioners.
Point No. 3.
.
Without prejudice, the impugned Act is unconstitutional for it suffers from vice of excessive
delegation:
83. In order to appreciate the rival contention of the parties, it would be necessary to refer to the
charging section, i.e. Section 15 of the impugned Act, which specifies that the user is liable to pay
water cess at such rates, as the Government of Himachal Pradesh, may fix vide notification. In terms
of sub Section 15(2) of the impugned Act, the State Government is empowered to review, increase,
decrease or vary the rates of water fixed under Section 15 of the impugned Act from time to time in
the manner it deems fit.
84. Notably, the power of fixation of rates has been delegated to the Government of Himachal
Pradesh i.e., the executive by the State Legislature without any guidance. While fixation of rates can
be left to a non-legislative body, the legislature must provide guidance for such fixation as held by
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in The Corporation of Calcutta and another vs. Liberty Cinema28, more
particularly, paras 21 to 26, which read as under:-
28 AIR 1965 SC 1107 "21. It was then said that if S. 548 authorised the levy of a tax as
distinct from a fee in return for services rendered, it was invalid as it amounted to an
illegal delegation of legislative functions to the Corporation because it left it .
entirely to the latter to fix the amount of the tax and provided no guidance for that purpose. We wish
to point out here that the contention now is that the section is invalid while the contention that we
have just dealt with proceeded on the basis that the section was valid as it provided for the levy of a
fee in return for services and as this necessarily implied a limit of the levy, namely, that it had to be
commensurate to the amount of the costs of the services, no guidance for 491 fixing the amount of
the fee to be levied was required to be provided. That argument only challenged the resolution on
the ground that it fixed the amount of the fee at a figure much in excess of the costs for the services
rendered.
22. Here again there is no dispute that a delegation of essential legislative power would be bad. It
was so held by this Court first in re The Delhi Laws Act.(1) The principle there laid down has been
summarised by Bose J.
in Rajnarain Singh v. The Chairman, Patna Administration Committee, Patna(2), in these terms:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193385936/
45Cwp No. 2916/2023 vs State Of H.P. & Ors on 5 March, 2024
"In our opinion, the majority view was that an executive authority can be authorised
to modify either existing or future laws but not in any essential feature. Exactly what
constitutes an essential feature cannot be enunciated in general terms, and there was
some divergence of view about this in the former case, but this much is clear from the
opinions set out above: it cannot include a change of policy."
23. On the basis that s. 548 is a piece of delegated legislation, it has been contended on behalf of the
Corporation that the rate of a tax is not an essential feature of legislation and the power to fix it was
properly .
delegated to the Corporation as sufficient guidance for that purpose was given in the Act. It is not in
controversy, and this indeed has been held by this Court, that if that is so, the section would be
unexceptionable. The question first is whether the power to fix the rate of a tax can be delegated by
the legislature to another authority; whether it is of the essence of taxing legislation. The contention
of the Corporation that fixation of rates is not an essential part of legislation would seem to be
supported by several judgments of this Court to some of which we now proceed to refer.
24. First, there is Pandit Benarsi Das Bhanot v. The State of Madhya Pradesh ( 3 ) . That case was
concerned with a Sales Tax Act which by s. 6(1) provided that no tax would be payable on any sale of
goods specified in a schedule to it. Item 33 of that Schedule read, "goods sold to or by the State
Government". Section 6(2) of the Act authorised the State Government to amend the schedule by a
notification.
In exercise of this power the Government duly substituted by a notification for item 33 the
following: "Goods sold by the State Government". The amendment of the schedule by the
notification was challenged on the round that s. 6(2) was invalid as it was a delegation of the (1)
[1951] S. C. R. 747 (2) [1955] 1 S. C. R. 290,301. (3) [1959] S. C. R. 427. 492 essential power of
legislation to the State Government. Venkatarama Aiyar J. delivering the judgment of the majority
of the Court sitting in a Constitution Bench, rejected this contention and after having read what we
have earlier set out from the judgment of Bose J. in Rajnarain Singh's case(1), observed at p. 435:
"On these observations, the point for determination .
is whether the impugned notification relates to what may be said to be an essential
feature of the law, and whether it involves any change of policy.
Now, the authorities are clear that it is not unconstitutional for the legislature to
leave it to the executive to determine details relating to the working of taxation laws,
such as the selection of persons on whom the tax is to be laid, the rates at which it is
to be charged in respect of different classes of goods, and the like."
The Act was a statute imposing taxes for revenue purposes. This case would appear to be express
authority for the proposition that fixation of rates of taxes may be legitimately left by a statute to a
non-legislative authority, for we see no distinction in principle between delegation of power to fix
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193385936/
46Cwp No. 2916/2023 vs State Of H.P. & Ors on 5 March, 2024
rates simpliciter; if power to fix rates in some cases can be delegated then equally the power to fix
rates generally can be delegated. No doubt Pandit Banarsi Das's case(1) was not concerned with
fixation of rates of taxes; it was a case where the question was on what subject mater, and therefore
on what persons, the tax could be imposed. Between the two we are unable to distinguish in
principle, as to which is of the essence of legislation; if the power to decide who is to pay the tax is
not an essential part of legislation, neither would the power to decide the rate of tax be so. Therefore
we think that apart from the express observation made, this case on principle supports the
contention that fixing of the rate of a tax is not of the essence of legislative power.
25. In regard to the observations in Pandit Benarsi Das's case(1) earlier quoted, it has been said that
the authorities .
on which they appear to have been based do not support it. It has been contended that as the
observations do not form part of the actual decision in the case, they need not be given that weight
which they would otherwise have been entitled to. In the High Court this contention appears to have
been accepted. The acceptance of the contention would result in by-passing a judgment of this Court
and that is something which cannot in any case be supported. We are furthermore of opinion that
the authorities to (1) [1955] 1 S. C. R. 290. (2) [1959] S. C. R. 427, 493 which Venkatarama Aiyar J.
referred fully support his observations. The first case relied upon by him was Powell v. Appollo
Candle Co. Ltd.(1). That case upheld the validity of a statute passed by the legislature of New South
Wales which conferred power on the Governor of that Province to impose duty on certain articles in
the circumstances prescribed. The Governor under this power imposed the tax and this was
challenged. The Judicial Committee rejected the contention that the tax had not been, imposed by
the Legislature which alone could do it in the view that "the duties levied under the Order in Council
are really levied by the authority of the Act" see p. 291. Here, therefore, a power conferred on the
Governor by the Legislature to levy a tax was upheld. It would follow that a power conferred to fix
rates of taxes has equally to be upheld. The next case was Syed Mohamed v. State of Madras(2).
There a power to an authority to determine who shall pay the tax was upheld. On the same principle
a power to determine at what rate he will have to pay the tax has to be upheld. The last case was
Hampton Jr. & Co. v. United States(3), in which the power conferred by a statute on the President to
make an increase or decrease .
in the rate of customs duty was upheld. There it was said at p. 630, "It is conceded by counsel that
Congress may use executive officers in the application and enforcement of a policy declared in law
by Congress and authorise such officers in the application of the Congressional declaration to
enforce it by regulation equivalent to law. But it is said that this never has been permitted to be done
where Congress has exercised the power to levy taxes and fix customs duties. The authorities make
no such distinction.
The same principle that permits Congress to exercise its rate making power in interstate commerce
by declaring the rule which shall prevail in the legislative fixing of rates, and enables it to remit to a
rate making body created in accordance with its provisions the fixing of such rates, justifies a similar
provision for the fixing of customs duties on imported merchandise." This therefore is clear
authority that the fixing of rates may be left to a non legislative body.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193385936/
47Cwp No. 2916/2023 vs State Of H.P. & Ors on 5 March, 2024
26. No doubt when the power to fix rates of taxes is left to another body, the legislature must
provide guidance for such fixation. The question then is, was such guidance provided in the Act ? We
first wish to observe that the validity of the guidance 1) 1 O. A. C. 282 (2) [1952] 3 S. T. C 367 (3)
[1927] 72 L. ed. 624. 494 cannot be tested by a rigid uniform rule; that must depend on the object of
the Act giving power to fix the rate. It is said that the delegation of power to fix rates of taxes
authorised for meeting the needs of the delegate to be valid, must provide the maximum rate that
can be fixed, or lay down rules indicating that maximum. We are unable to see how the specification
of the maximum rate supplies any guidance .
as to how the amount of the tax which no doubt has to be below the maximum, is to be fixed.
Provision for such maximum only sets out a limit of the rate to be imposed and a limit is only a limit
and not a guidance."
85. In addition to the above, it was necessary for the legislature to have laid down Legislative Policy,
standard or guidelines in the Act or else it is bound to suffer from vice of excessive delegation as
held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Gwalior Rayon Silk Mfg (Wvg.) Co. Ltd. vs. The Asstt.
Commissioner of Sales Tax and others29, wherein it was observed as under:-
"13. It may be stated at the outset that the growth of the legislative powers of the
executive is a significant development of the twentieth century. The theory of
laissez-faire has been given a go-by and large and comprehensive powers are being
assumed by the State with a view to improve social and economic well-being of the
people. Most of the modern socioeconomic legislations passed by the legislature lay
down the guiding principles and the legislative policy. The legislatures because of
limitation imposed upon by the time factor hardly go into matters of detail. Provision
is, therefore, made for delegated legislation to obtain flexibility, elasticity, expedition
and opportunity for experimentation. The 29 (1974) 4 SCC 98 practice of
empowering the executive to make subordinate legislation within a prescribed sphere
has evolved out of practical necessity and pragmatic needs of a modern welfare state.
At the same time it has to be borne in mind .
that our Constitution-makers have entrusted the power of legislation to the
representatives of the people, so that the said power may be exercised not only in the
name of the people but also by the people speaking through their representatives. The
rule against excessive delegation of legislative authority flows from and is a necessary
postulate of the sovereignty of the people. The rule contemplates that it is not
permissible to substitute in the matter of legislative policy the views of individual
officers or other authorities, however competent they may be, for that r of the popular
'will as expressed by the representatives of the people. As observed on page 224 of
Vol. 1 in Cooley's Constitutional Limitations, 8th Ed.
"One of the settled maxims in constitutional law is, that the power conferred upon
the legislature to make laws cannot be delegated by that department to any other
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193385936/
48Cwp No. 2916/2023 vs State Of H.P. & Ors on 5 March, 2024
body or authority. Where the sovereign power of the State has located the authority,
there it must remain; and by the constitutional agency done the laws must be Made
until the constitution Itself is changed. The power to whose judgment, wisdom and
patriotism this high prerogative has been entrusted cannot relieve itself of the
responsibility by choosing other agencies upon which the power shalt be devoted, nor
can it substitute the judgment, wisdom, and patriotism of any other body for those to
which atom the people have seen fit to confide this sovereign trust."
86. Furthermore, the impugned Act clearly fails to lay .
down one of the critical components of taxing statute i.e. measure of tax. It is trite in law that in
order to make a levy of tax to be operative and valid, four essential components must be provided in
enacting statute, creating the tax/impost i.e.:
(i) taxable event attractive the levy;
(ii) the person whom the levy is imposed and who is obliged to pay the tax;
(iii) the rate at which the tax is imposed and;
(iv) the measure of value to which the rate will be applied for computing the tax
liability.
87. This was so held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in M/s Govind Saran Ganga Saran vs.
Commissioner of Sales Tax and others30, wherein it was observed as under:-
"6. The components which enter into the concept of a tax are well known. The first is
the character of the imposition known by its nature which prescribes the taxable
event attracting the levy, the second is a clear indication of the person on whom the
levy is imposed and who is obliged to pay the tax, the third is the rate at which the tax
is imposed, and the fourth is the measure or value to which the rate will be applied
for computing the tax liability. If those components are not clearly and definitely 30
AIR 1985 SC 1041 ascertainable, it is difficult to say that the levy exists in point of
law. Any uncertainty or vagueness ill the legislative scheme defining any of those
components of the levy will be fatal to its validity."
.
88. In the instant case, three essential components can be clearly identified within the impugned
statute, which are taxable events, "the person liable to pay tax" and the "rate of tax". However, the
impugned legislation fails to identify the fourth and equally critical component i.e. measure of tax,
which is the value on which the rate of tax will be applied for computing the tax liability.

49Cwp No. 2916/2023 vs State Of H.P. & Ors on 5 March, 2024
89. Section 15 of the impugned Act provides that the user shall be liable to pay water cess at such
rates fixed by the Government, it fails to prescribe the value based on which such rates will be
applied.
90. Here, we may note that it was in exercise of powers vested under Section 15(2) of the impugned
Act that the State Government issued a Notification dated 26.08.2023 (supra), whereby the tariff
structure on water cess was fixed on the basis of "Head". However, even the said notification failed
to prescribe the measure of tax and instead proceeded to prescribe tariff rate without any indication
or measure on which such tariff rate will be applied. Moreover, measure of tax being vague, based
upon the "assessment" or water drawn, which would form the basis of the tax imposed is also vague
and fraught with lack of adequate guidelines, as is evident from the combined .
reading of Section 12 with Section 17 of the impugned Legislation (supra).
91. That apart, even the Statement of Objects and Reasons as well as the preamble of the impugned
Act does not lend any guidance for the delegate. The preamble of the impugned Act merely states
that it is an act to levy water cess on hydropower generation in the State of Himachal Pradesh, the
Statement of Objects and reasons merely states that the objective of the impugned Act is revenue
generation. Therefore, on account of having delegated power to fix rates of impugned levy to
Government of Himachal Pradesh without any legislative policy or guidance, the impugned Act is
unconstitutional.
This point is accordingly answered in favour of the petitioners.
4. Promissory Estoppel:
92. In view of the aforesaid discussion, the question of promissory estoppel has been
rendered academic and, therefore, need not be answered.
Conclusion:

93. In view of the aforesaid discussion, all the writ petitions are allowed in the
following terms:-
(i) The provisions of the Himachal Pradesh Water Cess on Hydropower Electricity
Generation Act, 2023, are declared to be beyond the legislative competence of the
State Government in terms of Articles 246 and 265 of the Constitution of India and,
thus, ultra vires the Constitution.
(ii) Consequently, the Himachal Pradesh Water Cess on Hydropower Electricity
Generation Rules 2023, are also quashed and set aside.

not legally contribute to Kevin McGinley's death.” Id. at *1. After four years of subsequent
investigations and considerable wrangling, Plaintiffs initiated a wrongful death action in 2002,
which was dismissed due to the statute of limitations. Id. at *2. Plaintiffs then filed a section
1983 action against various state employee defendants, claiming that “they were misled with
respect to Kevin McGinley's cause of death, unaware of the necessary facts to bring a wrongful
death action against UPS before the limitation period expired February 13, 2000 …” Id. This
lawsuit was also barred by the statute of limitations, but Plaintiffs beseeched the Court to apply
equitable tolling “based on what Plaintiffs characterize a ‘grossly negligent’ investigation and
supervision, as well as continual acts to cover up said actions.” Id. at *7.
This is also, in essence, what the Plaintiffs are claiming in this case. In McGinley, the
plaintiffs
continually criticized FHP's investigation and channels of command, retained
multiple experts to reconstruct and evaluate the evidence, presented those
evaluations via reports to authorities to highlight conflicts and inconsistencies in
Defendant Jetton's conclusions, and suspected law enforcement officers of sinister
motivation and criminal wrongdoing to the extent they demanded an independent
criminal investigation through the Governor's Office as early as 2000.
The McGinley Court rejected the application of equitable tolling under those circumstances, and
this Court should likewise reject the Plaintiffs’ equitable tolling arguments here. Like in
McGinley, the Plaintiffs here knew that they had a cause of action related to the ill treatment and
killing of Victor Jara as early as 1973. In 1989, Mr. Barrientos became available for personal
service in Florida. In 1990, the Pinochet regime was toppled in Chile, removing whatever threats
of reprisal or intimidation may have previously existed.
Plaintiffs also claim that equitable tolling is justified due to “an unwillingness on the part
of those with knowledge to come forward.” Doc. 63 at para. 46. It is clear from the Eleventh
Circuit’s precedent in Cabello, Jean, and Arce that affirmative misconduct rising to the level of
Case 6:13-cv-01426-RBD-GJK Document 82 Filed 03/03/15 Page 12 of 15 PageID 874
13
active, deliberate concealment—not difficulties in identifying witnesses or a general
unwillingness by witnesses to come forward—is required before equitable tolling becomes
appropriate. No such conduct is alleged here. In fact, the 40-year delay in the filing of this
lawsuit has created the very witness problem addressed in Arce: many, if not most,
eyewitnesses, including alibi witnesses for Mr. Barrientos, may “no longer be alive to provide
their accounts of the events in question.” Arce, 434 F.3d at 1265. These circumstances compel
the conclusion that this dispute is untimely.
Plaintiffs complain about the adequacy of the Chilean authorities’ investigation into the
matter, but fail to allege how the Chilean government deliberately concealed or falsified
information during those investigations. Plaintiffs fail to allege how “state sponsored acts of
violence and oppression” precluded them from investigating, particularly after 1990. Plaintiffs
cite the 1978 Amensty Law as a bar to criminal prosecution within Chile up to 1998, but fail to
allege how the Amnesty Law precluded them from consulting public records to learn the names
of the military personnel involved in operations at Chile Stadium, especially after 1990.
Plaintiffs also cite a general unwillingness on the part of witnesses to come forward, again
without alleging any type of deliberate concealment. None of these allegations constitute
extraordinary circumstances required to justify equitable tolling in the Eleventh Circuit. To the
contrary, witness problems caused by the death of numerous eyewitnesses in the 40-year time
period between 1973 and 2013 support the conclusion that Plaintiffs’ claims are time-barred.
It is therefore apparent from the face of the Plaintiffs’ Second Amended Complaint that
all claims are time-barred, and Plaintiffs failed to allege facts sufficient to justify extending the
extraordinary remedy of equitable tolling in this case. Accordingly, this Court should dismiss
the Plaintiffs’ Second Amended Complaint as time-barred.

CONCLUSION
The Plaintiffs’ ATS claims must be dismissed, because this Court is without subject
matter jurisdiction in light of Kiobel and Baloco. The Plaintiffs’ claims, including their TVPA
claims, must also be dismissed, because it is apparent from the face of the Second Amended
Complaint that all claims are time-barred. Even when accepted as true and viewed in a light
most favorable to the Plaintiffs, the allegations in the Second Amended Complaint do not
demonstrate extraordinary circumstances required to justify equitable tolling beyond 1990.
WHEREFORE, Defendant Pedro Barrientos respectfully requests that this Court dismiss the
Plaintiffs’ Second Amended Complaint.

MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
These procedures explain how to present and oppose motions for summary judgment. You
should follow these procedures and Rule 56 carefully.
These procedures require careful preparation of statements of proposed findings of fact. The
purpose of these statements of proposed findings of fact is to clearly identify the essential
facts material to the motion for summary judgment, and to help the court determine if those
facts are genuinely disputed. A dispute of fact is genuine if both sides have evidentiary
support for their positions. Accordingly, these procedures are also designed to help the court
see the evidentiary support for the proposed facts. The court will not search the record for
facts or evidence.
The fact documents are most useful if the proposed facts, and especially the responses and
replies to those facts, are succinctly stated. The fact documents should not be inflated with
lengthy argument. If the responses to fairly proposed facts, or the replies to fairly disputed
facts, are inappropriately argumentative, then the court may strike the offending response, or
in extreme cases, an offending pleading.
Because the material facts must be proposed in a statement of proposed facts, it is not
necessary to repeat all those facts in the briefs. However, the court will find it helpful to have
the background facts concisely stated in an introductory section of the brief.
I. The motion for summary judgment
A. Contents:
1. A motion that clearly states the claims or defenses, or the parts of claims or defenses,
for which summary judgment is sought.
2. A statement of proposed findings of fact that includes all facts needed to sustain the
motion.
3. Evidentiary materials that support the proposed facts (see I.C.).
4. A supporting brief. Your brief is the place to make your legal argument, not the place
to introduce facts into the record. However, you may find it helpful to include a
concise overview of the background facts of the dispute. When you finish the brief,
you should confirm that all the dispositive facts that you rely on are stated in the
proposed findings of fact document.
B. Proposed findings of fact:
1. The purpose of the statement of proposed findings of fact is to clearly identify the
material facts and to allow the court to determine whether those facts are genuinely in
dispute.
2
2. The statement of proposed findings of fact must include all facts necessary to sustain
the motion for summary judgment, including facts relating to jurisdiction and the
identity of the parties.
3. A party must propose each fact in a separate, numbered paragraph, limited as nearly
as practical to a single factual proposition.
4. Each factual proposition must be followed by a reference to evidence supporting the
proposed fact. The citation must identify where in the record the evidence is located.
If a party cites an affidavit of a witness who has submitted multiple affidavits or the
deposition of a witness who has been deposed multiple times, then the citation must
include the date that the document was created. Where possible, include the docket
number. For example:
1. Plaintiff Smith bought six Holstein calves on July 11, 2006. Harold
Smith Affidavit, Jan. 6, 2007, p.1, ¶ 3.
5. Documents at issue in the case (e.g., patents, contracts, insurance policies, etc.) should
be placed into the summary judgment record with a single proposed fact. For example:
1. The contract between Smith and Jones is attached as Exhibit 1 to
the Smith Affidavit.
Do not propose multiple facts restating the individual provisions of the document. Do
not propose facts stating your argument about the meaning of the document.
6. Do not propose facts reciting expert opinions or parties’ arguments. You should
address these issues in your brief with citations to the appropriate docket entries.
C. Evidence
1. As noted in I.B. above, a party must support each proposed finding with admissible
evidence. The court will not search the record for evidence. Where possible, provide
the docket number for the supporting evidence.
2. A proposed fact can be supported with any of the following evidence:
 Depositions. Give the name of the witness, the date of the
deposition, and page of the transcript of cited deposition testimony.
 Answers to Interrogatories. State the number of the interrogatory
and the party answering it.
 Admissions made pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 36.
State the number of the requested admission and the identity of the
party to whom it was directed; or
 Other Admissions. Identify the document, the number of the page,
and paragraph of the document in which that admission is made.
3
 Affidavits. The page and paragraph number, the name of the affiant,
and the date of the affidavit. (Affidavits must be made by persons
who have first-hand knowledge and must show that the person
making the affidavit is in a position to testify about those facts.)
 Documentary evidence that is shown to be true and correct, either
by an affidavit or by stipulation of the parties. (State exhibit
number, page, and paragraph.)
II. The response to a motion for summary judgment
A. Contents:
1. A brief in opposition to the motion for summary judgment.
2. A response to each of the moving party’s proposed finding of fact.
3. If necessary, additional proposed findings of fact needed to oppose the motion.
4. Evidentiary materials cited in the response to the moving party’s facts or in the
additional facts proposed by the non-moving party (following the instructions in
section I.C. above).
B. If the responding party proposes its own findings of fact, it should following the
procedure in I.B. and I.C. above. The purpose of additional proposed findings of fact is to
supplement the moving party’s proposed findings of fact, not to dispute the facts proposed
by the moving party. Even if the responding party files additional proposed findings of
fact, it must also respond to the each of the moving party’s proposed findings of fact.
C. The court will conclude that a proposed fact is undisputed unless the responding party
explicitly disputes it and either identifies contradictory evidence in the record, or
demonstrates that the proponent of the fact does not have admissible evidence to support
it.
D. Responses to the moving party’s proposed findings of fact:
1. Answer each numbered fact proposed by the moving party in separate paragraphs,
using the same number. The court strongly prefers that the responding party repeat
verbatim the moving party’s proposed fact and then respond to it.
2. All responses should be succinctly stated.
3. State clearly whether the fact is disputed or undisputed. If you dispute a proposed fact,
state your version of the fact and cite to evidence that supports that version. For
example:
1. Plaintiff Smith bought six Holstein calves from Dell’s Dairy Farm
on July 11, 2006. Harold Smith Affidavit, Jan. 6, 2007, p.1, ¶ 3.
4
Response: Disputed. The purchase Smith made from Dell’s
Dairy Farm on July 11, 2006, was for one Black Angus bull.
John Dell Affidavit, Feb. 1, 2007, Exh. A.
You may state your version of a proposed fact, but do not respond to proposed facts
with additional facts that are not directly responsive to the proposed fact. The court
will disregard any new facts that are not directly responsive to the proposed fact. If a
responding party believes that more facts are necessary to tell its side of the story, it
should include those facts in its own proposed facts, as discussed in II.B.
4. You may also dispute a fact on the grounds that the cited evidence does not support
the proposed fact with admissible evidence. For example:
1. The Smith farm maintains high standards of animal health and
nutrition. John Johnson Affidavit, Jan. 12, 2007, p.1, ¶ 5.
Response: Disputed. The Johnson Affidavit is inadmissible
because it is not based on personal knowledge. John Johnson is
plaintiff’s attorney, and he does not have personal knowledge of
the operation of the Smith farm.
5. Your response to a proposed fact may also indicate that the proposed fact is
immaterial. For example:
1. The Smith farm maintains high standards of animal health and
nutrition. John Johnson Affidavit, Jan. 12, 2007, p.1, ¶ 5.
Response: Undisputed, but immaterial.
You may state that a fact is immaterial, but do not respond to proposed facts with
arguments on the merits. Make your argument in your brief, with citations to any
useful docket entries.
E. Evidence
Every factual proposition, whether made in support of or opposition to, a motion for
summary judgment must be supported by admissible evidence. The court will not
search the record for evidence. Supporting evidence should be clearly cited and
submitted as described in I.C.2.
III. The reply by the moving party
A. Contents:
1. A reply to each numbered factual statement made by the responding party in response
to the moving party’s proposed findings of fact, together with references to
evidentiary materials.
5
2. A response to each additional numbered factual statement proposed by the
responding party, if any, together with references to evidentiary materials.
3. A reply brief.
4. Evidentiary materials (see I.C.)
B. Replies should be succinctly stated. If the response to a fact is “undisputed,” the reply
should also state “undisputed.” If you contend that despite a response of “disputed,” the
non-moving party has failed to raise a genuine dispute of material fact, you should
succinctly state why. For example:
1. Plaintiff Smith bought six Holstein calves from Dell’s Dairy Farm
on July 11, 2006. Harold Smith Affidavit, Jan. 6, 2007, p.1, ¶ 3.
Response: Disputed. The purchase price for the calves was not
for fair market value. John Dell Affidavit, Feb. 1, 2007, p.1, ¶ 4.
Reply: Undisputed. The response asserts an immaterial
fact, but it raises no dispute of the proposed fact.
C. If the responding party has filed additional proposed findings of fact, the moving party
should file its response to those proposed facts at the same time as its reply, following the
procedure in II.D.
D. When the moving party replies to the responses to the moving party’s original proposed
findings of fact, the moving party must repeat verbatim the entire sequence associated
with each proposed finding of fact. In other words, the reply document is a self-contained
history of all proposed facts, responses, and replies. Likewise, the moving party’s response
to the supplemental facts proposed by the non-moving party should also be a self-
contained history of those proposed facts with responses.
IV. A sur-reply by responding party
A responding party may not file a sur-reply without first obtaining permission from the
court. The court permits sur-replies only in rare, unusual situations.
6
The charts below identify the materials that each party must submit in support of or in
opposition to a motion for summary judgment. The preliminary pretrial conference order will
contain the specific deadline for dispositive motions. Usually, the deadline for a response will
be 21 days after the deadline for the motion, and the deadline for the reply will be 10 days
after the deadline for the response.
If only one party moves for summary judgment:
Deadline for dispositive
motions
Deadline for response Deadline for reply
The moving party files:
 motion for summary judgment
 brief in support
 statement of proposed
findings of fact
 supporting evidence
The moving party does not file
anything
The moving party files:
 brief in reply
 reply to the response to its
proposed findings of fact
 response to any supplemental
proposed findings of fact
The non-moving party does not
file anything
The non-moving party files:
 brief in opposition
 response to the moving party’s
proposed findings of fact
 supplemental proposed
findings of fact (optional)
The non-moving party does not
file anything
If both parties move for summary judgment:
Deadline for dispositive
motions
Deadline for response Deadline for reply
The plaintiff files:
 motion for summary judgment
 brief in support
 statement of proposed
findings of fact
 supporting evidence
The plaintiff files:
 brief in opposition to the
defendant’s motion
 response to the defendant’s
proposed findings of fact
 supplemental proposed
findings of fact (optional)
The plaintiff files:
 brief in reply to its motion
 reply to the response to its
proposed findings of fact
 response to any supplemental
proposed findings of fact
The defendant files:
 motion for summary judgment
 brief in support
 statement of proposed
findings of fact
 supporting evidence
The defendant files:
 brief in opposition to the
plaintiff’s motion
 response to the plaintiff’s
proposed findings of fact
 supplemental proposed
findings of fact (optional)
The defendant files:
 brief in reply to its motion
 reply to the response to its
proposed findings of fact
 response to any supplemental
proposed findings of fact

GUIDANCE TO PRO SE LITIGANTS
REGARDING MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
This court expects all litigants, including persons representing themselves, to follow this
court’s procedures to be followed on motions for summary judgment. If a party does not
follow the procedures, there will be no second chance to do so. The following is a list of
mistakes that pro se plaintiffs tend to make when opposing a motion for summary judgment:
1. Problem: The plaintiff does not answer the defendant’s proposed facts correctly.
Solution: To answer correctly, the plaintiff must file a document titled “Response to
Defendant’s Proposed Findings of Fact.” In this document, the plaintiff must answer
each numbered fact that the defendant proposes, using separate paragraphs that have
the same numbers as defendant’s paragraphs. See II.D. If the plaintiff does not object
to a fact that the defendant proposes, he should answer “Undisputed.”
2. Problem: The plaintiff submits a set of facts without answering the defendant’s facts.
Solution: II.B. allows the plaintiff to file his own set of proposed facts in response to
the defendant’s motion only if he thinks he needs additional facts to prove his claim.
But even if the plaintiff submits his own set of facts, he must also respond to the facts
proposed by the defendant.
3. Problem: The plaintiff does not tell the court and the defendant where there is
evidence in the record to support his version of a fact.
Solution: The plaintiff must pay attention to II.D.3., which explains how to dispute a
proposed fact. Also, the plaintiff should pay attention to I.B.4., which explains how a
new proposed fact should be written.
4. Problem: The plaintiff supports a fact with an exhibit that the court cannot accept as
evidence because it is not authenticated.
Solution: I.C. explains what may be submitted as evidence. A copy of a document will
not be accepted as evidence unless it is authenticated. That means that the plaintiff,
or someone else who has personal knowledge of what the document is, must declare
under penalty of perjury in a separate affidavit that the document is a true and correct
copy of what it appears to be. For example, if the plaintiff wants to support a
proposed fact with evidence that he received a conduct report, he must submit a copy
of the conduct report, together with an affidavit in which he declares under penalty of
perjury that the copy is a true and unaltered copy of the conduct report he received on
such and such a date.
NOTE WELL: If a party fails to respond to a fact proposed by the opposing party, the court
will accept the opposing party’s proposed fact as undisputed. If a party’s response to a
proposed fact does not comply with the court’s procedures or cites evidence that is not
admissible, the court will take the opposing party’s factual statement as true and undisputed.

HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SACHIN DATTA
JUDGMENT
1. The present petitions assail orders dated 06.02.2025 1 and 25.02.20252 passed by Telecom
Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal, New Delhi Order dated 06.02.2025 has been passed in
M.A. No. 412/2024 in B.P. No. 429/2024 Order dated 25.02.2025 has been passed in M.A. No.
42/2024 in B.P. No. 457/2024 and connected matters.
(hereinafter referred to as the "TDSAT"), in the context of application/s filed by the respondent no.3
seeking modification of earlier interim order/s passed in the Broadcasting petitions filed by the
petitioner.
2. At the outset, it is noticed that the factual matrix is identical in all these petitions and these
petitions are also predicated on identical grounds. In the above circumstances, these petitions are
being disposed of by way of a common order.
FACTUAL MATRIX
3. The petitioner is a broadcaster/channel provider which owns and operates several television
channels and digital platforms across the country in the name and style of "TV9" under the aegis of
'TV9 Network'. The respondent no.3 (the main contesting party in each of these petitions) is a Multi
System Operator 3 (hereinafter referred to as the "MSO") which operates its cable networks in
various territories and after receiving signals from the petitioner/broadcaster, retransmits the said
signals either to their associated Local Cable Operators ("LCOs") or directly to the subscribers.
4. The present petitions have been filed in the backdrop of litigation/s pending between respondent
no.3 and the petitioner before the TDSAT against disconnection/switching off of the petitioner's
channel/s, (inter alia, 'TV9 Telugu') on 06.06.2024 in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana by
multi-system operator" or "MSO" means a cable operator who has been granted registration under
Rule 11 of the Cable Television Networks Rules, 1994 and who receives a programming service from
a broadcaster and re-transmits the same or transmits his own programming service for

3Associated Broadcasting Company Pvt. ... vs Union Of India & Ors. on 8 April, 2025
simultaneous reception either by multiple subscribers directly or through one or more local cable
operators [Regulation 2(dd) of Interconnection Regulations, 2017] respondent no.3. It is alleged
that the said discontinuation/switching off was carried out without issuance of mandatory
disconnection notice as mandated under Regulation 17 of the Telecommunication (Broadcasting and
Cable) Services Interconnection (Addressable systems) Regulations, 2017 4 (hereinafter referred to
as "Interconnection Regulations,2017")
5. Vide an interim order dated 05.07.2024, in B.P. No.163/2024 and connected matters, the TDSAT
directed "uninterrupted and unhindered transmission of televisions namely, "TV9 Telugu and NTV
Telugu" with the same Logical Channel Number (LCN), same position and same packages which was
existing prior to 06.06.2024". Vide an order dated 13.09.2024, aforesaid direction was confirmed by
the TDSAT. The aforesaid order dated 05.07.2024 was preceded by the order dated 24.06.2024
passed by this Court in W.P.(C) 8688/2024, which, inter alia, reads as under:-
"25. This Court also notes that the petitioner has already filed petitions before TDSAT
and has approached this Court only in the interregnum, since there is no Vacation
Bench in the TDSAT.
26. Accordingly, it is directed that in terms of the submission made on behalf of
respondent no. 2, the transmission of the television channel, i.e., „TV9 Telugu shall
continue uninterruptedly and unhindered on the same position, as existing prior to
06th June, 2024. With regard to further grievances of the petitioner, it is noted that
the petitioner has
17. Disconnection of signals of television channels. --No service provider shall
disconnect the signals of television channels without giving at least three weeks'
notice in writing to other service provider, clearly specifying the reasons for the
proposed disconnection:
Provided that the period of three weeks' notice shall start from the date of receiving
the notice by the other service provider:
Provided further that the distributor of television channels shall, fifteen days prior to
the date of disconnection, inform the subscriber, through scrolls on the channels
proposed to be disconnected, the date of disconnection of signals of such television
channels:
Provided also that no service provider shall display notice for disconnection of signals
of television channels in form of static images overlaid on the television screen,
obstructing normal viewing of the subscribers.
already filed the petitions before TDSAT.
27. Accordingly, no further orders are required to be passed in the present petitions."

6. It is averred in the present petitions that respondent no.3 failed to comply with the aforesaid
directions passed by the TDSAT, and instead, in violation of the aforesaid interim order, issued a
notice for migration of the petitioner's channel from bouquet 5 to a-la-carte6 offering. Against the
migration notices issued by respondent no.3, the petitioner filed petitions before the TDSAT,
inter-alia seeking a stay of the aforesaid notices.

channel, there was also an understanding that the channel offered by the petitioner shall be made
part and parcel of the bouquet offered by the respondent no.3. In reaching this conclusion, the
impugned order draws from the implication flowing from Regulation 3(4) of the Interconnection
Regulations, 2017 read with Regulation 10(11) of the Interconnection Regulations, 2017.10
9. Based on the aforesaid observations, the impugned orders directed the respondent no.3 to offer
the petitioner's channels, (inter alia, 'NTV Telegu' and 'TV 9 Telegu') to its subscribers on a-la-carte
basis. It was further directed that the concerned respondent shall also scrupulously follow the
Channel Placement Agreement during its existence. The interim order/s previously granted were
accordingly modified.
10. Consequently, aggrieved with the aforesaid vacation of interim order/s earlier passed by the
TDSAT, the present petitions have been filed by the petitioner under Article 226 of the Constitution
of India.
SUBMISSION ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
11. The learned senior counsel on behalf of the petitioner by placing reliance on judgment passed by
the Rajasthan High Court in Maharaja Shri Umaid Mills Ltd. v. Industrial Tribunal, 1954 SCC
OnLine Raj 23 and Jammu and Kashmir High Court in Mohd. Yaqoob Shah v. State (UT of
Paragraph 19 of order dated 25.02.2025 passed by TDSAT in MA. No. 42/2024 in B.P No. 457/2024
and connected matters J&K) submits that the provision of Section 18 of the Telecom Regulatory
Authority of India Act, 1997 (hereinafter 'TRAI Act') makes available a right of statutory appeal,
however, the said right is not available against an interlocutory order/s and as a consequence
thereof, the petitioner does not have any other alternative remedy except to file the present
petitions. Thus, it is submitted that the present petitions are maintainable and the petitioner
possesses a right of judicial review against the impugned order, which seriously prejudices and
adversely affects its rights.
12. It is further submitted that a Distribution Platform Operator (DPO) of the MSO platform, who is
entitled to frame its bouquet/s of channel, is also obligated to give LCN to each channel on its
platform. Furthermore, as per Regulation 18(4) of the Interconnection Regulation, 2017, the DPO of
the MSO platform is mandatorily required to continue the LCN given to any channel on its platform
for a period of one year and the same cannot be altered prior to expiry of aforesaid period.
13. It is contended that the Regulation 3(4) of the Interconnection Regulations, 2017, does not bar,
rather permits the parties to enter into 'Channel Placement Agreements' on the basis of mutual
negotiations and therefore any such channel placement agreement entered into between the parties
is valid, legal, binding and enforceable.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179147523/
6Associated Broadcasting Company Pvt. ... vs Union Of India & Ors. on 8 April, 2025
14. It is also strenuously contended that neither Regulation 3(4) nor Regulation 10(11) of the
Interconnection Regulations, 2017, have any applicability in the facts and circumstances of the case
inasmuch as the said Regulations do not prevent the parties from entering into appropriate
commercial arrangements for placement, marketing etc.
15. It is submitted that the purpose of entering into a Channel Placement Agreement was not only
for placement of the channel but also for making the channel/s of the petitioner part of all the
bouquets offered by the respondent no.3. It is further submitted that inclusion of the petitioner's
channel/s in all of its bouquets, was on the basis of Channel Placement Agreement between the
parties.
16. It is submitted that the placement of channel of the petitioner in terms of the said Agreement is
inextricably linked to making the petitioner's channel a part of all the bouquets offered by the
respondent no.3. For else, there would have been no occasion to enter into a Channel Placement
Agreement only for securing an LCN inasmuch as it is anyway obligatory under Clause 18(3) and
18(4) of the Interconnection Regulations, 2017, to assign an LCN to the petitioner.
17. It is submitted that the language of the notice issued by the respondent no.3 itself suggests that
there was a pre-existing agreement for the purpose of making the channels of the petitioner a part of
all the bouquets offered by the respondent no.3. It is contended that this understanding has been a
term of the extant Agreement between the parties and has been acted upon, ever since the outset.
18. In the above circumstances, it is submitted that the impugned order is liable to be set aside since
the TDSAT has erroneously relied upon Regulations 3(4) and 10(11) of the Interconnection
Regulation, 2017 and has omitted from considering the other relevant Regulations and the aforesaid
aspects.
SUBMISSION ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT NO.3
19. Learned senior counsel on behalf of the respondent no.3 controverts the maintainability of the
present petitions inasmuch as:
i. the parties are based out of Andhra Pradesh/Telangana and the Channel Placement
Agreement/s between the parties is for distribution of the channel of the petitioner in
the said areas. It is submitted that no part of the cause of action has arisen within the
jurisdiction of this Court and merely on the basis that the impugned order has been
passed by the TDSAT in New Delhi, it cannot be inferred that this Court will have
jurisdiction. In this regard, reliance is placed on the judgment rendered by this Court
in Sterling Agro Industries Ltd. v. Union of India and Others, 2011 SCC OnLine Del
3162.
ii. there is no occasion for this Court in exercise of jurisdiction under Article 226/227
of the Constitution of India to exercise jurisdiction when there has been no error in
passing the impugned order. Moreover, the impugned order, being an interim order,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179147523/
7Associated Broadcasting Company Pvt. ... vs Union Of India & Ors. on 8 April, 2025
is necessarily subject to the final outcome of the Broadcasting petitions filed by the
petitioner. It is further stated that in the said Broadcasting petitions, the petitioner
has, inter alia, prayed for grant of "appropriate costs and compensation" and that all
pleas of the petitioner on the merits or pertaining to intricate factual aspects shall be
duly considered by TDSAT at an appropriate stage.
20. It is further submitted that the petitioner has resorted to suppression of material facts inasmuch
as it has not placed on record certain documents, inter alia, a copy of the miscellaneous application
filed by the petitioner before TDSAT against the respondent no.3, seeking identical reliefs as prayed
for in the present petitions; miscellaneous application filed by the respondent no.3 and the
pleadings therein for modification of ex-parte orders dated 20.11.2024; 21.11.2024 and 04.12.2024.
It is further submitted that the petitioner has also concealed W.P (C) 3221/2025 titled 'Vinsat
Digital Pvt Ltd v. Associated Broadcasting Company Pvt. Ltd and Ors.' filed before the Andhra
Pradesh High Court. It is stated that the said litigation culminated vide an order dated 22.01.2025
passed therein, whereby, the petition was disposed of in view of 'mutual understanding' being
arrived at between the parties. The said order reads as under:-
"2.The petitioner filed M.A No.412 of 2024 in B.P. No. 429 of 2024 seeking
modification/recall of the orders dated 20.11.2024 and 04.12.2024, which are in the
nature of exparte orders. When the matter came up for consideration, the respondent
herein/petitioner before the Tribunal sought for time to file reply to the petition, the
Honble Tribunal confirmed the interim order passed order on 20.11.2024 vide order
dated 04.12.2024 to make it applicable during pendency of the case without the
matter being heard on merits at the interim stage and posted for final hearing of
main petition i.e. B.P Nos.427, 428 & 429 of 2024, posted on 06.02.2025. While so,
the petitioner herein filed M.A No.412 of 2024 which was listed on 19.12.2024 and
before TDSAT , learned counsel for the petitioner therein requested time for filing
reply. TDSAT issued notice in the said application granting Respondent no.1 time to
file its reply within 06.02.2025, thereby allowing the impugned orders to continue.
3. During hearing, Sri P. Sri Raghuram, learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner and
Sri. O Manohar Reddy, learned Senior Counsel appearing for Respondent No.1
mutually agreed to contest M.A. No.412 of 2024 in B.P No. 429 of 2024 before the
Hon'ble TDSAT on merits instead of contesting the main petition. Both parties
agreed upon to submit reply along with relevant and necessary documents to the
Tribunal.
4. In view of the mutual understanding arrived by and between both the Senior
Counsel, this Court deems it appropriate to dispose the writ petition, without
touching the merits of the case, leaving it open to both the parties to contest M.A. No.
412 of 2024 in B.P. No.429 of 2024 before the Hon'ble Telecom Dispute Settlement
and Appellate Tribunal on merits, which is scheduled for hearing on 06.02.2025.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179147523/
8Associated Broadcasting Company Pvt. ... vs Union Of India & Ors. on 8 April, 2025
5. It is further agreed by the respondents herein, that they would file reply on or
before 06.02.2025 and they will argue the matter on 06.02.2025 itself without
requesting further time, but, as per convenience of the Hon'ble Tribunal.
6. Hence, in view of the above, this Court is inclined to dispose of this writ petition,
requesting the Hon'ble Tribunal to hear and dispose of M.A. No.412 of 2024 in B.P.
No.429 of 2024 either on 06.02.2025 or on any other early date as per its
convenience, since both parties agreed to argue the matter on 06.02.2025 itself."
21. On merits, it is submitted that the relationship between the parties is governed solely by the
'Channel Placement Agreement', in terms of which, the respondent no.3 is obligated only to allocate
the mutually agreed LCN to the petitioner. It is stated that no other agreement has been executed
between the parties and the Channel Placement Agreement cannot be interpreted to subsume an
obligation on the respondent to include the petitioner's channel in all of its bouquet's offerings.
22. It is further submitted that the sole purpose of the Agreement was to allot a preferred/better
LCN to the channel/s of the petitioner and not for including the petitioner's channel as part of any
bouquet offered. Reliance is placed on Regulation 3(4) of the Interconnection Regulations, 2017, to
contend that there is a bar on a Broadcaster proposing, demanding or stipulating that its channel be
made part of any bouquet. It is also contended that the Channel Placement Agreement is itself
determinable and therefore, it is impermissible to seek specific performance thereof.
23. It is submitted that the migration notice issued by the respondent no.3 was only in the nature of
intimation and cannot be construed to be an admission of any implied contract qua
packaging/carrying channel of the petitioner in bouquets offered. It is submitted that the perusal of
the said notice also reveals that there was no impediment in the respondent no.3 making changes in
the bouquets offered and in providing for availability of the channel of the petitioner on an
a-la-carte basis.
24. Lastly, it is submitted that the impugned order does not suffer from any legal infirmity and/or
error apparent on the face of the record. It is pointed out that the impugned order only permits the
respondent no.3 to alter the bouquets offered, and protection earlier granted to the petitioner with
respect to the contractual entitlement of the petitioner under the agreement/s remains unaffected.
Further, it is emphasized that the impugned order specifically records that all contentions of the
parties have been kept open, to be considered at the time of final hearing of the Broadcasting
petitions.
ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSION
25. Although, the respondent is right in contending that the parties to the present disputes are based
out of Andhra Pradesh/Telangana and the Agreement between the parties is for distribution of the
channel of the petitioner in the said State/s, this Court has entertained the present petitions since on
previous occasion/s, this Court in WP(C) 8688/2024 and CONT. CAS (C) 999/2024 [alongwith
connected matters], dealt with the same controversy (albeit in a different context) and passed orders
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179147523/
9Associated Broadcasting Company Pvt. ... vs Union Of India & Ors. on 8 April, 2025
dated 24.06.2024 and 02.07.2024. It was in the light of the said order/s passed by this Court that
the TDSAT had continued/granted certain interim order/s, which have now been modified by the
impugned order/s.
26. However, having perused the impugned order, and considering the submissions by the
respective counsel, this Court finds that there is no justification to interfere with the impugned
order/s in exercise of jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The reasons are as
under:-
(i) The impugned order gives multiple reasons for modifying the pre-
existing interim order/s passed in favour of the petitioner. The impugned order takes note of the
extant Regulatory mechanism and on the basis of Regulation 3(4) 11 read with Regulation 10 (11) 12
of the Interconnection Regulations, 2017, reaches the conclusion that the same clearly proscribes a
Broadcaster from proposing, stipulating or demanding, directly or indirectly, packaging of its
channel in any particular bouquet offered by the Distributor of television channels to
3. General obligations of broadcasters. -- [....] (4) No broadcaster shall propose, stipulate or demand
for, directly or indirectly, packaging of the channel in any particular bouquet offered by the
distributor of television channels to subscribers.
10. Interconnection agreement between broadcaster and distributor of television channels. -- [....]
(11) A broadcaster shall not incorporate any provision, directly or indirectly, in its interconnection
agreement with a distributor of television channels which require such distributor of television
channels to include the channel or bouquet of pay channels offered by the broadcaster in any
particular bouquet of channels offered by such distributor to the subscribers and any agreement to
contrary shall be void.
subscribers. The language of the aforesaid regulations is quite unambiguous in this regard. Thus,
there is, prima facie, merit in the reasoning given in the impugned order;
(ii) Even assuming the petitioner is right in contending that it is possible to enter into an agreement
in derogation of Regulation 3(4) of the Interconnection Regulations, 2017, a bare perusal of the
'Channel Placement Agreement/s' between the parties reveals that the same does not even deal with
or contain any provision as regards making the channel/s of the petitioner a part of any bouquet/s
to be offered by the respondent no.3 to its subscribers;
(iii) Although, it is true that under Regulation 18(3) and 18(4) of the Interconnection Regulations,
2017 13, it is a mandatory obligation of the respondent no.3 to necessarily allot a LCN to each of its
channel/s on its platform, evidently, the only purport of the 'Channel Placement Agreement/s'
executed between the parties was to assign a particular favourable/preferred LCN to the petitioner
within its genre 14, for which the consideration was paid by the petitioner. Entering into an
agreement for the purpose of assigning a particular LCN (as per the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179147523/
10Associated Broadcasting Company Pvt. ... vs Union Of India & Ors. on 8 April, 2025
18. Listing of channels in electronic programme guide.--[...] (3) Every distributor of television
channels shall assign a unique channel number for each television channel available on the
distribution network.
(4) The channel number once assigned to a particular television channel shall not be altered by the
distributor [without prior approval of the Authority]:
Provided that this sub-regulation shall not apply in case the channel becomes
unavailable on the distribution network:
[Provided further that if a broadcaster changes the genre or language of a channel
then the channel number assigned to that particular television channel shall be
changed in order to place such channel with the channels of the new genre or
language in the electronic program guide.] News Channel petitioner's preference) is
quite different from assuming any obligation to make the petitioner's channel/s a
part of the respondent no.3's 'bouquet offerings' to its subscribers;
(iv) Reliance sought to be placed on the migration notice issued by the respondent
no.3 cannot by itself lead to an inference that there is an Agreement between the
petitioner and the respondent no.3 for the purpose of including the channel of the
petitioner as part of the bouquets offered by the respondent no.3 to its subscribers.
The respondent no.3 is right in contending that no such inference is called for, given
the express language of the Channel Placement Agreement/s. Had it been intended
that the respondent no.3 is obliged to make the channel of the petitioner as part of its
bouquet offering to its subscribers, then nothing would have been easier than to so
provide the Channel Placement Agreement/s;
(v) The fact that the respondent no.3 has been including the channel of the petitioner
as part of its "bouquets offerings" to its subscribers in the past, does not, by itself,
create any legal right in favour of the petitioner for continuation of the same
arrangement;
(vi) The impugned order also rightly notes that under Regulation 11 of the QoS
Regulations, 2017 15, it is permissible for the respondent
11. Introduction, discontinuation and modification of bouquets in other cases. -- (1)
No distributor of television channels shall introduce a new bouquet or discontinue
any existing bouquet available on its platform, without giving a prior notice of at least
fifteen days to all the subscribers by running scrolls on television screen and such
notice shall also be displayed on customer care programming service.
(2) No distributor of television channels shall modify the composition of any existing bouquet
available on its platform if all the channels forming part of the bouquet continue to be available on
its platform:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179147523/
11Associated Broadcasting Company Pvt. ... vs Union Of India & Ors. on 8 April, 2025
no.3 to discontinue any existing bouquet available on its platform by giving a prior
notice to the subscribers by running scrolls and displaying a notice on the "customer
care programming service";
(vii) The Tariff Order, 2017, also specifically contemplates merely a reporting
requirement for the purpose of bringing about a change in the composition of
bouquet or paying channel/s. The relevant provision in this regard is as under: -
"7. Reporting requirement by distributors of television channels. - ............
[Provided also that any subsequent change in the network capacity fee, name, nature,
language, distributor retail prices of pay channels, distributor retail price or
composition of bouquet of pay channels and composition of bouquet of free-to-air
channels, network capacity fee for each additional TV connection beyond first TV
connection in a multi TV home, long term subscriptions, maximum retail price of
platform services and introduction or discontinuation of any channel on its platform,
as the case may be,--
(a) shall be reported to the Authority, in such manner, as may be specified, at least
fifteen days prior to such change, and
(b) shall also be simultaneously published on the website of the distributor.]
(viii) Given the aforesaid position, the impugned order, on a prima facie conspectus,
rightly concludes that the respondent no.3 is permitted to alter the bouquet offered to
the subscribers after complying with the requirements as set out in Regulation 11 of
the QoS Regulations, 2017;
Provided that it shall be permissible for the distributor to discontinue the existing bouquet and
introduce new bouquet after complying with the procedure prescribed in sub-regulation (1).
(ix) This Court finds nothing amiss in the aforesaid findings, so as to warrant interference in
exercise of jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. Reference in this regard may
be made to a judgment of a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in Hari Vishnu Kamath v.
Syed Ahmad Ishaque and Others, (1954) 2 SCC 881, wherein, it has been observed as under: -
"24.3. The court issuing a writ of certiorari acts in exercise of a supervisory and not
appellate jurisdiction. One consequence of this is that the Court will not review
findings of fact reached by the inferior court or tribunal, even if they be erroneous.
This is on the principle that a court which has jurisdiction over a subject-matter has
jurisdiction to decide wrong as well as right, and when the legislature does not choose
to confer a right of appeal against that decision, it would be defeating its purpose and
policy, if a superior court were to rehear the case on the evidence, and substitute its
own findings in certiorari. These propositions are well settled and are not in dispute.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179147523/
12Associated Broadcasting Company Pvt. ... vs Union Of India & Ors. on 8 April, 2025
25. The further question on which there has been some controversy is whether a writ
can be issued, when the decision of the inferior court or tribunal is erroneous in law.
This question came up for consideration in R. v. Northumberland Compensation
Appeal Tribunal, ex p Shaw [R. v. Northumberland Compensation Appeal Tribunal,
ex p Shaw, (1951) 1 KB 711] , and it was held that when a tribunal made a "speaking
order" and the reasons given in that order in support of the decision were bad in law,
certiorari could be granted. It was pointed out by Lord Goddard, C.J. that that had
always been understood to be the true scope of the power. Walsall Overseers v.
London & North Western Railway Co. [Walsall Overseers v. London & North Western
Railway Co., (1878) LR 4 AC 30 at p. 39 (HL)] and R. v. Nat Bell Liquors Ltd. [R. v.
Nat Bell Liquors Ltd., (1922) 2 AC 128] were quoted in support of this view. In
Walsall Overseers v. London & North Western Railway Co. [Walsall Overseers v.
London & North Western Railway Co., (1878) LR 4 AC 30 at p. 39 (HL)] , Lord
Cairns, L.C. observed as follows : (AC p. 39) "... if there was upon the face of the order
of the court of quarter sessions anything which showed that that order was
erroneous, the Court of Queen's Bench might be asked to have the order brought into
it, and to look at the order, and view it upon the face of it, and if the court found error
upon the face of it, to put an end to its existence by quashing it...."
In R. v. Nat Bell Liquors Ltd. [R. v. Nat Bell Liquors Ltd., (1922) 2 AC 128] Lord Sumner said : (AC
p. 156) "... That supervision goes to two points : one is the area of the inferior jurisdiction and the
qualifications and conditions of its exercise; the other is the observance of the law in the course of its
exercise."
(x) Again, a co-ordinate Bench of this Court in Deora Cable Natworks v. Den Network Ltd., 2024
SCC OnLine Del 394, held as under:-
"15. The scope and ambit of exercise of power and jurisdiction by a High Court under
Article 227 of the Constitution of India is examined and explained in a number of
decisions of this Court. The exercise of power under this article involves a duty on the
High Court to keep inferior courts and tribunals within the bounds of their authority
and to see that they perform the duty expected or required of them in a legal manner.
The High Court is not vested with any unlimited prerogative to correct all kinds of
hardship or wrong decisions made within the limits of the jurisdiction of the
subordinate courts or tribunals. Exercise of this power and interfering with the
orders of the courts or tribunals is restricted to cases of serious dereliction of duty
and flagrant violation of fundamental principles of law or justice, where if the High
Court does not interfere, a grave injustice remains uncorrected. It is also well settled
that the High Court while acting under this article cannot exercise its power as an
appellate court or substitute its own judgment in place of that of the subordinate
court to correct an error, which is not apparent on the face of the record. The High
Court can set aside or ignore the findings of facts of an inferior court or tribunal, if
there is no evidence at all to justify or the finding is so perverse, that no reasonable
person can possibly come to such a conclusion, which the court or tribunal has come

to[Refer : Estralla Rubber v. Dass Estate (P) Ltd., (2001) 8 SCC 97]."
27. In the aforesaid circumstances, this Court is not inclined to interfere with the impugned order.
This is especially considering that the impugned orders are interlocutory in nature and necessarily
subject to the final outcome of the petitions filed by the petitioner 16 which, inter alia, claims
compensation from the respondent/s. All rights and contentions of the parties are reserved and
shall necessarily be considered at the stage of disposal of the Broadcasting petitions.
28. In the circumstances, this Court finds no merit in the present petitions; the same are,
consequently, dismissed. All pending applications also stand disposed of.

II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY
This action came on regularly for trial on October 30, 2012. On November 7, 2012, the
matter was submitted to the jury. The jury was impaneled to render a verdict as to Caldwell’s
legal claims and to issue an advisory opinion as to all other derivative based equitable claims. On
November 8, 2012, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Caldwell. Of relevance to this motion,
the jury found that Ecobaby entered into a contract with Caldwell and eventually breached the
contract. The jury awarded $54,382 in damages to Caldwell as a result of Ecobaby’s conduct.
On December 3, 2012, the parties submitted post-trial briefs to the Court in preparation
for oral argument as to all claims that remained unresolved and awaiting judgment of the Court.
On December 7, 2012, after oral argument, the Court awarded $750,000 in damages to Dorothy
and Ginny Turner on behalf of Ecobaby. Additionally, the Court awarded Caldwell $1 in
damages against Ginny Turner for Breach of Fiduciary Duty. For the purposes of ruling on the
equitable claims, the Court found there was no contract between Caldwell and Ecobaby.
III. LEGAL ARGUMENT
A. The Court Has The Authority to Grant Ecobaby a Judgment Nothwithstanding the
Verdict or to Set Aside/Vacate the Part of the Judgment Finding the Existence of a
Contract, Breach of Contract and Consequent Damages.
Code of Civil Procedure section 629 provides that the Court may grant Ecobaby a JNOV
where a motion for a directed verdict on the Breach of Contract claim should have been granted
had a previous motion been made. Stated another way, Ecobaby’s motion for JNOV may be
granted where there was no substantial evidence to support the part of the verdict finding a
contract existed and was entered into between Caldwell and Ecobaby. See Garretson v. Miller
(2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 563. However, when deciding whether to grant a JNOV, the court must
disregard all conflicting evidence and indulge in every legitimate inference that may be drawn in
support of the judgment, and may grant the motion only if there is no substantial evidence to

NOTWITHSTANDING THE VERDICT AND MOTION TO VACATE JUDGMENT
5
support the verdict. Brennan v. Townsend & O'Leary Enterprises, Inc., (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th
1336, 1345.
Code of Civil Procedure section 663 provides that the court may set aside and vacate a
judgment based upon a decision by the special verdict of a jury and have another and different
judgment entered when there was: 1) an incorrect or erroneous legal basis for the decision; or 2) a
decision not consistent with or not supported by the facts.
As discussed below, the decision by the jury that a contract existed between Caldwell and
Ecobaby was not supported by sufficient evidence. The evidence set forth during trial did not
provide substantial evidence that all of the necessary elements of a contract were present. Simply
stated, if no contract was created, there could be no breach of contract. Furthermore, and in the
alternative, the jury’s determination the contract between Caldwell and Ecobaby was breached
was founded on the erroneous and incorrect legal basis that the necessary elements of a contract
were present and therefore a contract was created in the first place.
B. Caldwell Failed to Set Forth Substantial Evidence Demonstrating The Essential
Elements of a Contract.
CACI Jury Instruction 302 provides, in part, that the plaintiff must prove all the following
elements of a contract to show its existence:
• (1) That the contract terms were clear enough that the parties could understand what each
was required to do;
• (2) That the parties agreed to give each other something of value [a promise to do
something or not to do something may have value]; and
• (3) That the parties agreed to the terms of the contract.
• [When you examine whether the parties agreed to the terms of the contract, ask yourself
if, under the circumstances, a reasonable person would conclude, from the words and
conduct of each party, that there was an agreement. You may not consider the parties'
hidden intentions.]
i. Definite Terms
Courts have made clear no contract exists without a clear understanding by the parties of
MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR JUDGMENT
NOTWITHSTANDING THE VERDICT AND MOTION TO VACATE JUDGMENT
6
what is required by each party. The Court in Weddington Productions, Inc. v. Flick, (1998) 60
Cal.App.4th 793 opined that “[i]n order for acceptance of a proposal to result in the formation of
a contract, the proposal ‘must be sufficiently definite, or must call for such definite terms in the
acceptance, that the performance promised is reasonably certain.’” Id. at 811 (distinguished on
other grounds); citing 1 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law, (9th ed. 1987) Contracts, § 145, p. 169.
At oral argument in the instant case, the Court set forth an example of reasonably certain
terms stating: “This is an agreement ... I’ll charge you X dollars a month. Fine … That’s an oral
agreement or if you have it written down, that’s a written agreement. I didn’t see any of that here
… I saw nothing of that here.” (See Exhibit B, Transcript of Oral Argument at 6-7; 25-28, 1-2;
Caldwell, et al. v. Turner, et al.) Indeed, no evidence was presented during trial demonstrating
the parties agreed on the amount to be charged for services rendered or exactly what services
would be rendered in exchange. Consequently, the terms of the purported contract were not
reasonably certain and therefore no contract came into existence. As a result, the jury could not
find a breach of the contract by Ecobaby.
It is within a court’s power to make a finding that an essential element of a contract is
missing and therefore a contract does not exist as a matter of law. CCP § 629; Galiano v. Pacific
Gas & Electric Co., (1937) 20 Cal.App.2d 534. Courts have stated that whether a contract’s
terms are reasonably definite is a matter of law. Ladas v. California State Automobile
Assn., (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 770, fn. 2; citing Ersa Grae Corp. v. Fluor Corp., (1991) 1
Cal.App.4th 613, 623. From a procedural standpoint, a court is empowered to make this
determination at various stages of the case including demurrer, motion for summary judgment or
a directed verdict. The same test governs the Court’s power to grant a JNOV as a directed
verdict. Knight v. Contracting Engineers Co., (1961) 194 Cal.App.2d 435. Accordingly, if the
Court finds as a matter of law a contract cannot have existed, relief may be effected by granting a
JNOV.
Here, in light of the lack of evidence presented in trial demonstrating the contract’s
reasonably definite terms, the Court should grant Ecobaby’s Motion for JNOV as to Caldwell’s
claim for Breach of Contract.

ii. Consideration
As indicated by the abovementioned CACI instruction, for there to be a valid contract the
parties must each provide something of value to the other. As set forth in Restatement Second of
Contracts (1981) section 71, comment “e” at page 176: “It matters not from whom the
consideration moves or to whom it goes. If it is bargained for and given in exchange for the
promise, the promise is not gratuitous.” Flojo Internat., Inc. v. Lassleben, (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th
713, 719 (emphasis added).
During trial, unrebutted evidence was put forth that Caldwell, in his capacity as a director
and shareholder, was providing Ecobaby with a place to host its website for free. Notably, he was
providing these services well before any sort of contract was allegedly formed. As emphasized
by Ecobaby in trial, zero evidence was put forth that there was any kind of bargaining between
the parties as to the cost of the service. Conversely, Ecobaby claimed there was no bargaining
because there was neither a discussion of terms nor an agreement. As the Court stated during oral
argument: “[Caldwell] was helping them out … there was no consideration.” (See Exhibit B,
Transcript of Oral Argument at 5-6; 25; Caldwell, et al. v. Turner, et al.).
Substantial evidence was not presented during trial to demonstrate there was any service
of value being exchanged that was not already being provided by Caldwell in his capacity as a
director and shareholder of Ecobaby. Further, there was a complete lack of evidence of any kind
of bargaining that led to the exchange of said consideration. Any consideration that could be
discerned from the evidence was gratuitous, at best.
iii. Agreement
Mutual consent is an essential element of a contract. Civ. Code § 1550. Civil Code
section 1580 provides, in relevant part: “Consent is not mutual, unless the parties all agree upon
the same thing in the same sense.” Interpreting Civil Code section 1580, courts have determined
that “[t]he existence of mutual consent is determined by objective rather than subjective criteria,
the test being what the outward manifestations of consent would lead a reasonable person to
believe.” Weddington Productions, Inc., 60 Cal.App.4th at 811; citing Meyer v. Benko, (1976) 55
Cal.App.3d 937, 942-943.

During trial, Caldwell plainly testified there was an agreement that Ecobaby would
receive Caldwell’s services in exchange for compensation. This was in dispute. However, the
fact that the amount to be paid, if any, was not agreed upon, was not challenged by Caldwell.
Instead, the amount Caldwell alleged Ecobaby owed was backdated from a date far in the future.
This, in context, was not substantial evidence permitting an inference that there was a contract.
The outward manifestations of consent that would lead a reasonable person to believe there was
consent were not present. First, the services being rendered by Caldwell before the alleged
agreement were near identical to those being provided after the said agreement. Second,
Caldwell was not invoicing Ecobaby, Inc. contemporaneously with the purported services being
rendered. Rather, he testified that many years after the alleged agreement was made, after
thousands of dollars of services were provided and payment for which remained outstanding, he
then compiled a massive statement of account. Of significance, this statement was thrown
together once Caldwell and his ex-wife Ginny Turner (a director of Ecobaby) were embroiled in a
contentious family law action. Finally, all the while, Ecobaby was not making payments for these
expensive services performed by Caldwell.
Indeed, there was very little, if any, evidence of outward manifestations of the consent of
both parties to this agreement. Even viewing Caldwell’s testimony in the light most favorable to
Plaintiff, as the standard for granting this motion demands, there cannot be a finding that
substantial evidence was presented to demonstrate that Caldwell and Ecobaby agreed upon the
same thing in the same sense.

IV. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Ecobaby respectfully requests that the Court grant the motions
herein, and that the Judgment in this action be modified as against Ecobaby Organics, Inc. as

Petitioner :- M/S Anandeshwar Agro Foods Private Ltd
Respondent :- State Of Up And 3 Others

Counsel for Petitioner :- Sr. Advocate,Utkarsh Prasad
Counsel for Respondent :- C.S.C.


Hon'ble Anjani Kumar Mishra,J.
Hon'ble Jayant Banerji,J.

(Per: Hon. Jayant Banerji,J.)

1. This writ petition has been filed seeking quashing of the demand notice/ order dated 19.2.2024 and the order cancelling the mining lease dated 27.2.2024 both passed by the District Magistrate, Kanpur Dehat. Also under challenge is the order of 18.4.2024 passed by the Special Secretary, Geology and Mining, U.P. in Revision No. 33(R)/G&M/(U.P)/2024, M/s. Anandeshwar Agro Foods Pvt. Ltd. vs. District Magistrate, Kanpur Dehat (Annexure-1 to the writ petition) filed by the petitioner whereby his revision has been rejected. A further prayer seeks direction to the respondents not to demand any monthly installments specified in the lease deed for the months of October, November and December, 2023, and, January and February, 2024.

2. An advertisement/auction notice dated 3.12.2018 was issued by the District Magistrate, Kanpur Dehat for grant of mining leases of sand/morrum under Chapter IV of the U.P. Minor Mineral (Concession) Rules, 19631 by e-tender cum e-auction for a period of five years for all vacant mining areas in Kanpur Dehat district. The bid of the petitioner, in respect of plot No.58 measuring 08.275 hectares at Village-Bilaspur Kachhar, Tehsil-Sikanda, District-Kanpur Dehat, of Rs.264 per cubic meter, being the highest bid, was approved by the District Magistrate and a Letter of Intent was issued to the petitioner on 5.2.2019. The petitioner applied for a mining plan which was sanctioned by the competent authority and thereafter the petitioner applied for obtaining an Environment Clearance Certificate, which was granted to the petitioner on 15.1.2021. Thereafter, a lease-deed was executed in favour of the petitioner on 12.3.2021 for a period of five years permitting winning of 1,10,057 cubic meters per annum of sand/morrum with the installments (excluding the security amount) for the first year totaling Rs.2,90,55,048.00 and for each successive year, the royalty payable would be increased by 10% on the royalty payable in the previous year. An amount of Rs.2,20,31,460.00 was deposited by the petitioner as security.
3. It is stated that the petitioner had carried out mining operations and paid the entire installments due upto 30.6.2023 as per the payment schedule specified in the lease-deed. A notice dated 2.6.2023 was issued by the Additional District Magistrate (Administration), Kanpur Dehat directing the petitioner to get the pre-monsoon and post-monsoon replenishment study done of his mining area. The petitioner got the replenishment study of pre-monsoon done on 25.6.2023. It is stated that even after post-monsoon, the leased area was completely submerged and, hence, it was not possible to carry out post-monsoon survey and no mining operations were possible and, therefore, the petitioner moved an application on 5.10.2023 before the District Magistrate requesting him not to compel the petitioner to deposit the lease amount post-monsoon till the replenishment study was done. It is stated that the post-monsoon survey was done on 29.10.2023 and a combined report of pre-monsoon and post-monsoon was submitted before the District Magistrate. The Mines Officer issued a demand notice dated 25.11.2023 demanding the installment of October and November 2023. The petitioner moved an application dated 28.11.2023 stating that the entire leased area is submerged and a very small patch of surface was seen which belonged to the restricted area. Again, a request was made by the petitioner to the District Magistrate to waive off the installment for the period starting from 1.10.2023 till actual commencement of the mining operations.
4. Again, the Mines Officer issued a demand notice to the petitioner on 4.12.2023 demanding the due installments. The petitioner sent an application dated 11.12.2023 to the District Magistrate requesting him to waive off the installments for the period with a further request that the petitioner be allowed to get the leased area re-assessed by the competent agency for proper compliance and verification of the actual mineable reserve.
5. By a letter dated 21.12.2023, the District Magistrate rejected the aforesaid applications of the petitioner on the ground that it is the responsibility of the petitioner to pay the installments stated in the lease-deed. The petitioner again on 8.1.2024 got the leased area re-inspected for post-monsoon replenishment study for assessing the quantity of available mineral. It is stated that the new replenishment study report of 08.01.2024 reflected no significant replenishment of river bed mineral and the replenished mineral on the leased land on that date was 16,380 cubic meters. The opinion in this replenishment study was that the mineral quantity may increase in future once the water recedes.
Thereafter, the petitioner moved an application dated 27.1.2024 indicating his willingness to initiate mining operations provided the installments for the disrupted period from 1.10.2021 till the actual commencement of mining operations be waived and further installments be 're-evaluated' as per the actual mineral recharge/replenished quantity as found in the post-monsoon replenishment study report. This application of the petitioner was rejected by the District Magistrate by means of a demand notice/order dated 19.2.2024. It is stated that the impugned order dated 27.2.2024 was received by the petitioner on 29.2.2024 by email canceling the mining lease of the petitioner. The petitioner then filed a revision before the State Government which was dismissed by the impugned order dated 18.4.2024.
6. It is contended by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the cancellation of the mining lease and the rejection of the revision of the petitioner is without consideration of the evidence and against the statutory provisions. It is stated that once an area is declared by the State Government to be leased out by e-tender/e-auction/e-tender cum e-auction, the District Officer is mandated to get that declared area evaluated for the quality and quantity of mineral for fixing minimum bid or offer which is to be done by the Director, Geology and Mining, Uttar Pradesh or by an officer authorised by him; that the replenishment study is required to be conducted as per the orders of the National Green Tribunal2; that it was incumbent on the State Government to make available the quantity of mineral required for excavation on the basis of which the petitioner would pay the installments of lease amount, otherwise the petitioner would be entitled for refund or remission of the installments; that if the State Government fails to provide mineral for excavation, then no lease instalment amount is payable; and that the notice issued under Rule 59 of the U.P. Minor Mineral (Concession) Rules, 20213 is required to be issued by the District Magistrate and not by the Mines Officer. In this view of the matter, it is contended that the District Magistrate having given the last notice on 19.2.2024, and the order canceling the lease having been passed on 27.2.2024, there is violation of Rule 59 of the Rules, 2021 which mandates 30+15 days notice.
In support of his contentions, learned counsel for the petitioner has relied upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in Dharmendra Kumar Singh vs. State of Uttar Pradesh4; a judgment dated 10.4.2018 passed by the Supreme Court in the case of M/s. Planet Steel Pvt. Ltd. vs. The State of Haryana & Ors.5; a decision of a coordinate Bench of this Court dated 11.1.2021 in the case of Vipul Tyagi vs. State of U.P. & 6 Ors.6 and a decision of this Court dated 24.10.2019 in the case of Ranjana Singh vs. State of U.P. & Ors.7.
7. A counter affidavit has been filed on behalf of the respondents stating that the lease-deed was executed on 12.3.2021 in respect of the leased area for excavation of 110057 cubic meters of sand/morrum per annum at the rate of Rs.264/-. The amount of security, the annual amount payable and the installments due and payable were specified in the lease-deed itself. It has been stated that material facts have been concealed in the instant writ petition inasmuch as Writ-C No.9186 of 2022 was filed by the petitioner before the Lucknow Bench of this Court seeking the following reliefs:-
â€œ1. issue a writ, order or direction in the nature of certiorari quashing the Government Order dated 9.11.2022 issued by the State Government i.e. Respondent no.1, contained as Annexure No.1 to this writ petition.
2. Issue a writ, order or direction in the nature of mandamus directing the respondents to waive of the liability of deposit of the royalty amount of the month of October 2022 & November 2022 so far it relates to the mining lease of the petitioner and do not compel to the petitioner to deposit the royalty amount for the aforesaid two months as no mining activity has taken place in the aforesaid months.
3. to issue any other writ, order or direction which this Hon'ble Court may deem fit and proper in the circumstances of the case.
4. to award cost of the petition to the petitioner.â€

In response to aforesaid petition, a counter affidavit was filed by the respondents opposing the writ petition and that petition is pending before the Lucknow Bench of this Court.
8. It is stated in the counter affidavit to the present petition that the notices dated 25.11.2023 and 4.12.2023 as well as the notices dated 21.12.2023 and 19.2.2024 were issued to the petitioner; that the representations filed by the petitioner were rejected on 21.12.2023 on the ground that nine months' time was available to the petitioner for mining for excavating the annual quantity of sand and sell it as per the market rate available and accordingly upload Form eMM-11 to the extent of the carried forward quantity in the preceding month that could not have been mined; that the pre-monsoon and post-monsoon replenishment study reports are contradictory and cannot be relied upon for any purpose by this Court; that post-monsoon replenishment report reflects a quantity of 16380 cubic meters of mineral available for mining which may further increase in future; that the amount of mineral could be excavated by the petitioner but he chose not to carry out any mining operations; that a surrender application for surrendering the mining lease as per Rule 30 of the Rules 2021 could have been filed by him but no such application was filed; that the petitioner has not brought on record the inspection report dated 13.2.2023; that illegal mining was being done in violation of Rule 42h(1) of the Rules, 2021, whereafter a notice dated 21.2.2023 was given to the petitioner imposing a penalty of Rs.5 lacs which notice has not been replied by the petitioner. In paragraph nos.18 and 19 of the counter affidavit, it is stated as follows:-
â€œ18. That it is humbly submitted before this Hon'ble Court that in case the lease holder is unable to extract the quantity of sand in a particular month then upon payment of the royalty amount the quantity not excavated is carried forward on the portal of the department automatically. It is also submitted herein that the practice and procedure is that in case the lease holder is to extract an additional quantity of sand, that he is unable to in a particular month, he has to pay the royalty amount of the succeeding month and extract the carried forward quantity (that was not extracted) of sand to be excavated in the next month. The said amount of sand has to be excavated keeping in view the annual quantity of sand to be extracted as per the amount mentioned in the Environmental Clearance Certificate.

19. That in the facts of the present case the amount of sand that could have been extracted in a particular year by the petitioner herein is 1,10,0057 cubic meter (sic, 110057) and 12,228.55 cubic meter per month. If the amount of 12,228.55 cubic meter could not be extracted by the petitioner in a particular month then the left over amount could be carried forward by him in the next month and extracted accordingly. The petitioner herein from Jan. 2023 to June 2023 has extracted sand in excess of 12,228.55 cubic meter and the generated EMM-11 form alongwith the production quantity bearing lease ID No. 313623 bearing Lease ID No. 313623090133 is being brought on record and is being filed herewith and marked as Annexure No.CA-9 to this Affidavit.â€

It is, therefore, contended that the orders passed by the District Magistrate as well as the State Government are justified.
10. In the rejoinder affidavit, the petitioner has relied upon a Government Order dated 12.11.2021 while stating that the relaxation was granted by the State Government in the payment of the lease amount proportionate to the quantity of mineral which the petitioner could not lift and the Government Order directed that the quantity which could not be lifted could be deducted from the annual quantity.
As regards the table filed alongwith the counter affidavit showing the Form eMM-11 generated by the petitioner and the amount of production of the mineral, it has been stated that the calculations were for the period from January 2023 to June 2023, when there was sufficient mineral available in the mining area and the petitioner had paid the entire lease amount uptil June. It is stated that in the present case, the entire area was submerged and, therefore, there was no occasion for carrying forward the minerals to be excavated. The dispute relates to the period commencing October 2023.
ANALYSIS
11. The emphasis of the petitioner is on the loss being suffered by the petitioner despite his every attempt to bonafide work the mining lease granted to him, due to lack of proper evaluation of the mining area and want of preparation of a District Survey Report8 which is mandated to be prepared after a replenishment study is conducted as per the Sustainable Sand Mining Management Guidelines-20169, which was supplemented with the Enforcement and Monitoring Guidelines for Sand Mining-202010. It has also been stated that the State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority, Uttar Pradesh, in its meeting held on 31.12.2022, had directed the Mines Department to ensure that no mining is carried out beyond the quantity mentioned in the replenishment study report.
12. The EMGSM-2020 was formulated by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Government of India. The Ministry had earlier formulated the SSMMG-2016 which focuses on the management of sand mining in the country. However, while observing in the EMGSM-2020 that apart from management and systematic mining practices, there is an urgent need to have guidelines for effective enforcement of regulatory provisions and their monitoring, the rampant and illegal mining, transportation and storage of minerals were noted with concern. The guidelines focus on the effective monitoring of sand mining from identification of sand mineral sources, its dispatch and end-use by consumers and the general public. It was felt necessary to identify the minimum requirements across all geographical regions to have a uniform protocol for monitoring and enforcement of regulatory provision prescribed for sustainable sand and gravel mining.
13. After noting various directions issued by the NGT and the Supreme Court from time to time, the EMGSM-2020 narrates the necessity of complying with the directions of the NGT. Though several requirements for monitoring and enforcement are mentioned, however, certain important requirements are extracted below:-
â€œii) The mining lease auctioned by State government as per their Minor Mineral Concession Rules are granted of Letter of Intent (Lol), but it has been observed that many of the sites are not suitable w.r.t environmental aspects. In most of the cases, the unplanned grant of mining lease leads to formation of cluster and/or contiguous cluster of small mining leases which sometimes is difficult to regulate and monitor. In order to address such issues, more emphasis is required on the preparation of District Survey Report and its format for reporting.
iii) Mining Plan is an important document to assist the mine owner to operate the mine in a scientific manner. States have their own format for preparation of mining plan and it is observed that recording of the initial level of mining lease at shorter interval say 25m X 25 m grid interval is not present.
iv) There is no practice for regular replenishment study to ascertain the rate of depositing, plan and section needs to be prepared based on the restrictions provided in letter of intent and provisions of Sustainable Sand Mining Management Guidelines 2016.
v) Environmental Clearance is a process wherein the regulatory authorities after considering the potential environment impact of mining clearance is granted with a set of specific & standard conditions to carry out mining operations, but often it is observed that letter of intent is granted for a location which has less potential for mining and not feasible for environment-friendly mining. This leads to an unnecessary financial burden on the mine owners and litigations. Thus, Lol should be preferably granted for those locations which have the least possibility of an impact on the environment and nearby habitation.
vi) It is the responsibility of the mine owner to obtain all the statutory clearance and comply with the conditions stipulated in the clearance letter. Mining should be carried out within the mining lease area as per approved mining plan or mining plan concurred by other regulatory authorities.

viii) The river reaches with sand provide the resource and thus it is necessary to ascertain the rate of replenishment of the mineral. Regular replenishment study needs to be carried out to keep a balance between deposition and extraction. This document provides the procedure to be followed for conducting replenishment study.Â 

14. The EMGSM-2020 highlights that preparation of the DSR is a very important step and that sustainable sand mining in any part of the country would depend on the quality of DSR. The DSR is required to be prepared under the SSMMG-2016. The guidelines emphasize detailed procedure to be followed for the purpose of identification of areas of aggradation/deposition where mining can be allowed and identification of areas of erosion and proximity to infrastructural structures and installation where mining should be prohibited. Calculation of annual rate of replenishment, allowing time for replenishment after mining, identification of ways of scientific and systematic mining; identifying measures for protection of environment and ecology and determining measures for protection of bank erosion, bench mark (BM) with respect to Mean Sea Level (MSL) should be made essential in mining channel reaches (MCR) below which no mining would be allowed. The judgment of the NGT of 8.12.2017 in the matter of Anjani Kumar vs. State of U.P. & Ors.11 is referred in the guidelines in this regard, in which judgment/order the following observation was made:
â€œIt states that the main object of preparation of District Survey Report is to ensure identification of areas of aggradation/deposition where mining can be allowed and identification of areas of erosion and proximity to infrastructural structures and installation where mining should be prohibited and calculation of annual rate of replenishment and allowing time for replenishment after mining area. Thus, the environmental protection requires a strictly regulated mining in terms of area, quantity as well as most importantly replenishment thereof.â€

Then, inter alia, the following order/direction was passed:
â€œThe data collection and declared for preparation of DSR shall take precedence over other data and would form the foundation for providing mining lease in terms of Appendix- x to the Notification dated 15th January 2016 must be prepared by the statutory authority stated therein i.e. DEIAA prior to awarding of permits for carrying on mining activity in any part of the State of UP.â€

15. Considering the importance of DSR, for purpose of preparation of comprehensive DSR for sand mining, certain guidelines were formulated, which are encapsulated below :-
(a) District Survey Report for sand mining shall be prepared before the auction/e-auction/grant of the mining lease/Letter of Intent (LoI) by Mining department or department dealing the mining activity in respective states.
(b) The first step is to develop the inventory of the River Bed Material and Other sand sources in the District. In order to make the inventory of River Bed Material, a detailed survey of the district needs to be carried out, to identify the source of River Bed Material and alternative source of sand (M-Sand). The source will include rivers, de-siltation of reservoir/dams, Patta lands/Khatedari Land, M-sand etc. It was proposed that for preparation of district survey report, the auditing of rivers needs to be carried out.
(c) District Survey Report is to be prepared in such a way that it not only identifies the mineral-bearing area but also define the mining and no mining zones considering various environmental and social factors.
(d) Identification of the source of Sand & M-Sand. The sources may be from Rivers, Lakes, Ponds, Dams, De-silting locations, Patta land/Khatedari lands.
(e) Defining the sources of Sand/M-Sand in the district is the next step for identification of the potential area of deposition/aggradation wherein mining lease could be granted. Detailed survey needs to be carried out for quantification of minerals. The purpose of mining in the river bed is for channelization of rivers so as to avoid the possibility of flooding and to maintain the flow of the rivers. For this, the entire river stretch needs to be surveyed and original ground level (OGL) to be recorded and area of aggradation/deposition needs to be ascertained by comparing the level difference between the outside riverbed OGL and water level.
(f) The permanent boundary pillars need to be erected after identification of an area of aggradation and deposition outside the bank of the river at a safe location for future surveying. The distance between boundary pillars on each side of the bank shall not be more than 100 meters.
(g) Identifying the mining and no mining zone shall follow with defining the area of sensitivity by ascertaining the distance of the mining area from the protected area, forest, bridges, important structures, habitation etc. and based on the sensitivity the area needs to be defined in sensitive and non-sensitive area.
(h) Demand and supply of the Riverbed Material through market survey needs to be carried out. In addition to this future demand for the next 5 years also needs to be considered.
(i) It is suggested that as far as possible the sensitive areas should be avoided for mining, unless local safety condition arises. Such deviation shall be temporary & shall not be a permanent feature.
(j) The final area selected for the mining should be then divided into mining lease as per the requirement of State Government. It is suggested the mining lease area should be so selected as to cover the entire deposition area. Dividing a large area of deposition/aggradation into smaller mining leases should be avoided as it leads to loss of mineral and indirectly promote illegal mining.
(k) Cluster situation shall be examined. A cluster is formed when one mining lease of homogenous mineral is within 500 meters of the other mining lease. In order to reduce the cluster formation mining lease size should be defined in such a way that distance between any two clusters preferably should not be less than 2.5 Km. Mining lease should be defined in such a way that the total area of the mining leases in a cluster should not be more than 10 Ha.
(l) The number of a contiguous cluster needs to be ascertained. Contiguous cluster is formed when one cluster is at a distance of 2.5 Km from the other cluster.
(m) The mining outside the riverbed on Patta land/Khatedari land be granted when there is possibility of replenishment of material. In case, there is no replenishment then mining lease shall only be granted when there is no riverbed mining possibility within 5 KM of the Patta land/Khatedari land. For government projects, mining could be allowed on Patta land/Khatedari land but the mining should only be done by the Government agency and material should not be used for sale in the open market. Cluster situation as mentioned in para k above is also applicable for the mining in Patta land/Khatedari land.
(n) The State Government should define the transportation route from the mining lease considering the maximum production from the mines as at this stage the size of mining leases, their location, the quantity of mineral that can be mined safely etc. is available with the State Government. It is suggested that the transportation route should be selected in such a way that the movement of trucks/tippers/tractors from the villages having habitation should be avoided. The transportation route so selected should be verified by the State Government for its carrying capacity.
(o) Potential site for mining having its impact on the forest, protected area, habitation, bridges etc, shall be avoided. For this, a sub-divisional committee may be formed which after the site visit shall decide its suitability for mining.
(p) Public consultation-The comments of the various stakeholders may be sought on the list of mining lease to be auctioned. The State Government shall give an advertisement in the local and national newspaper for seeking comments of the general public on the list of mining lease included in the DSR.
16. Para 4.2 of the EMGSM-2020 relates to grant of Letter of Intent to those mining leases which are falling in potential mining zones. It reads as under :-
â€œThe State Government shall issue letter of intent as per procedure laid down in their Minor Mineral Concession Rules with due consideration of final district survey report. The State Government shall ensure that all the letter of intent shall have complete details of the mining lease including geo- coordinate of the corner points, the involvement of forest land, distance from the forest land, distance from the protected area, distance from other sites of archaeological importance, details of the cluster situation etc. The demarcation of the boundaries of LoI/Lease area shall be placed in public domain along with LoI/lease deed details.
The LOI should not be granted for mining area falling on both riverbed and outside riverbed. Therefore, in the same lease, both types of area should not be included.
The authority responsible for grant of lease for sand mining shall ensure that annual audit of the sand mining process, production and compliance of the imposed conditions by regulatory authority (Environmental clearance or mine plan) shall be one of the essential condition of the lease agreement. The annual audit report shall be submitted to the district administration, which shall be put in public domain through the district website. Any deviation observed shall be appropriately and in accordance with applicable law shall be dealt by the concerned authority and corrective measures shall also be taken to restoration of ecological/environmental damage, if observed.â€

17. Para 4.3 deals with preparation of mining plan which reads as follows:-
â€œThe preparation of Mining Plan is also very important. The mining plan should include the original ground level recorded at an interval not more than 10M x 10M along & across the length of the river. In addition to this levels, outside the mining lease and bank of the river up to meters needs to be recorded. In the mining plan, there should be 3 plates for each year production & development planning (pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon). The time period of monsoon should be defined in the DSR. At the time of review of the mining plan, the details of the replenishment study conducted for all the years needs to be included in the mining plan. The Mining Plan should include the certificate from PCCF on forest land, distance from the protected area, past production details for mining leases seeking expansion.â€

18. The considerations that are required to be kept in mind for sand/gravel mining for approving mining plan have been specified, relevant provisions of which, for purpose of this case are mentioned below:-
(i) Parts of the river reach that experience deposition or aggradation shall be identified. The Leaseholder/ Environmental Clearance holder may be allowed to extract the sand and gravel deposit in these locations to manage aggradation problem.
(ii) The distance between sites for sand and gravel mining shall depend on the replenishment rate of the river. Sediment rating curve for the potential sites shall be developed and checked against the extracted volumes of sand and gravel.
(iii) Sand and gravel may be extracted across the entire active channel during the dry season.
(iv) Abandoned stream channels on the terrace and inactive floodplains be preferred rather than active channels and their deltas and flood plains. Stream should not be diverted to form inactive channel.
(v) Layers of sand and gravel which could be removed from the river bed shall depend on the width of the river and replenishment rate of the river.
(vi) The sediment sampling should include the bed material and bed material load before, during and after the extraction period. Develop a sediment rating curve at the upstream end of the potential reach using the surveyed cross-section. Using the historical or gauged flow rating curve, determine the suitable period of high flow that can replenish the extracted volume. Calculate the extraction volume based on the sediment rating curve and high flow period after determining the allowable mining depth.
(vii) Mining depth should be restricted to 3 meters and distance from the bank should be 1/4th or river width and should not be less than 7.5 meters.

19. Para 5 of the EMGSM-2020 provides for replenishment study, which reads as follows:-
â€œ5.0 Replenishment Study
The need for replenishment study for river bed sand is required in order to nullify the adverse impacts arising due to excessing sand extraction. Mining within or near riverbed has a direct impact on the stream's physical characteristics, such as channel geometry, bed elevation, substratum composition and stability, in-stream roughness of the bed, flow velocity, discharge capacity, sediment transport capacity, turbidity, temperature etc. Alteration or modification of the above attributes may cause an impact on the ecological equilibrium of the riverine regime, disturbance in channel configuration and flow-paths. This may also cause an adverse impact on in-stream biota and riparian habitats. It is assumed that the riparian habitat disturbance is minimum if the replenishment is equal to excavation for a given stretch. Therefore, to minimize the adverse impact arising out of sand mining in a given river stretch, it is imperative to have a study of replenishment of material during the defined period.
5.1 Generic Structure of Replenishment Study
Initially replenishment study requires four surveys. The first survey needs to be carried out in the month of April for recording the level of mining lease before the monsoon. The second survey is at the time of closing of mines for monsoon season. This survey will provide the quantity of the material excavated before the offset of monsoon. The third survey needs to be carried out after the monsoon to know the quantum of material deposited/replenished in the mining lease. The fourth survey at the end of March to know the quantity of material excavated during the financial year. For the subsequent years, there will be a requirement of only three surveys. The results of year-wise surveys help the state government to establish the replenishment rate of the river. Based on the replenishment rate future auction may be planned.
The replenishment period may vary on nature of the channel and season of deposition arising due to variation in the flow. Such period and season may vary on the geographical and precipitation characteristic of the region and requires to be defined by the local agencies preferable with the help of the Central Water Commission and Indian Meteorological Department. The excavation will, therefore, be limited to estimated replenishment estimated with consideration of other regulatory provisions.â€
(emphasis supplied)

20. Paragraph 6 of the EMGSM-2020 provides for enforcement. The mining operation and post environment clearance monitoring are being below for purpose of this case :-
â€œ6.1 Mining Operation:
The mining operations should be strictly carried out in accordance with the approved mining plan and after complying with all the conditions stipulated in Environmental & Other Statutory Clearance. Mine owner shall follow the operational procedure (for sale, dispatch, storage, reserve reconciliation and transportation) as may be defined by the concerned state government in its monitoring guidelines. Mine owner should comply with the recommendation and suggestion made by the High Power Committee as applicable.
6.2 Post Environment Clearance Monitoring:
It's the responsibility of the EC Holder to comply with the Environmental Clearance conditions and upload the six-monthly EC compliance report on the website of the Ministry. For the category, â€˜A' mines (>100 Ha individual & cluster) Regional Office of the MoEF&CC are entrusted to carry out EC Monitoring and for the Category â€˜B' Mines by SEIAA. The monitoring shall be carried out as per the procedure/schedule suggested by MoEF&CC from time to time. MOEF&CC vide its notification S.O. 637(E) dated 28.02.2014 has delegated the power to State/Union Territory Environmental Impact Assessment Authority to issue show cause notice to project proponent in case of violation of Conditions of Environmental Clearance issued by the said authority and to issue direction for keeping the said EC in abeyance or withdrawing it. Thus, for category â€˜Bâ€™ (0 to 100 Ha) projects SEIAAs are responsible for EC monitoring.


21. Paragraph 8, and particularly Paragraph 8.1 deal with the general approach to sustainable sand mining and prerequisite for starting sand mining operation and are as follows:-
â€œ8.0 General Approach to Sustainable Sand Mining
8.1 Pre-requisite for starting sand mining operation
i) All district to prepare a comprehensive mining plan for the district as per the provision of District Survey Report. These reports shall be put on the website of District Administration. No mining shall be allowed in the area which has not been identified in the comprehensive mining plan of the District.
ii) Replenishment study should be conducted on regular basis.
iii) All potential rivers mining zone/area shall be identified and put for auction with proper geo-tagged details by the auctioning authority concerned.
iv) The latitude and longitude of each mining lease shall be clearly mentioned in Letter of Intent issued to the potential mine lease. Such information shall be provided on the website of the district administration.
v) The provision of these guidelines shall be considered while identifying the potential stretches /locations and boundaries of the leases for the minable area.
vi) The LoI holder shall seek Environmental Clearance as per the provision of EIA Notification, and the regulatory authority shall ensure that the provision suggested in â€œSustainable Sand Mining & Management 2016" and in this documents, as applicable are part of the clearance conditions.
vii) There shall be no river bed mining operation allowed in monsoon period. The period as defined by IMD Nagpur for each state shall be adhered with.
viii) The monitoring infrastructures including weighbridge and adequate fencing of the lease area, CCTV, Transport permits, etc, as suggested in this document shall be ensured in order to reduce unrecorded dispatch.
ix) Regular monitoring of mined minerals and its transportation and storage shall be ensured and all information shall be captured at centralized database so that easy tracking of illegal material can be done.
x) Annual audit of each mining lease shall be carried out wherein three independent member of repute, nominated by District administration shall also participate.â

22. Thus, perusal of the EMGSM-2020 guidelines reflects that the Central Government has made provisions for undertaking detailed exercise by taking into account several environmental factors with regard to enforcement and monitoring of sand mining.
23. The concerns of the Central Government as reflected in the aforesaid guidelines also find echo in Rules 10, 17 of Chapter II, Rule 23 of Chapter IV, Rules 35, 36, 37, 38, 41, 42, 45 of Chapter V and other provisions of Rules, 2021. It is pertinent to mention here that the State Government also made the U.P. Minerals (Prevention of Illegal Mining, Transportation and Storage) Rules, 2018.
24. It is pertinent to mention here that a defining moment for environmentally sustainable and socially responsible mining of sand and gravel occurred when the Supreme Court expressed its opinion in this regard in the case of Deepak Kumar & Ors. vs. State of Haryana & Ors.12 wherein a direction was issued to the State Governments to follow the guidelines issued by the Central Government by framing appropriate rules. Pursuant to the order in Deepak Kumar, after extended deliberations and study, a draft Notification13 was issued by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change on 15.1.2016 bearing S.O. 141(E) under the provision of sub-section (1) and clause (v) of sub-section (2) of Section 3 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. This draft Notification of 2016 was for the express purpose for making certain amendments to the Environmental Impact Assessment Notification, 2006 issued vide number S.O. 1533(E) dated 14.9.2006 which was published under sub-rule (3) of Rule 5 of the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986 vide number S.O. 2588(E) dated 22.9.2015. The aforesaid Notification was also issued in compliance of certain observations made by the National Green Tribunal vide its order dated 13.1.2015 in the matter of sand mining wherein a direction was issued for making a policy on environmental clearance for mining leases in cluster for minor mineral.
25. It is important to note that in the case of Deepak Kumar (supra), a Committee was directed by the Supreme Court to examine whether there had been an attempt to flout the aforesaid Notification dated 14.9.2006 by breaking the homogeneous area into pieces of less than 5 hectares, and that whether the activities going on in that area had any adverse environmental impact.
The Supreme Court recorded a finding that it was without conducting any study on the possible environmental impact on/in the river beds and elsewhere, the auction notices had been issued. The Supreme Court was of the considered view that when faced with a situation where extraction of alluvial material within or near a river bed has an impact on the riverâ€™s physical habitat characteristics, like river stability, flood risk, environmental degradation, loss of habitat, decline in biodiversity, it was not an answer to say that the extraction (of sand etc.) was in blocks of less than 5 hectares, separated by 1 km., because their collective impact may be significant, hence necessity of a proper environmental assessment plan.
26. In the case of Deepak Kumar (supra), the issues and recommendations made by the Ministry were considered which provided for, inter alia, that the States and Union Territories would see that mining of minor minerals is subjected to simpler but strict regulatory regime after taking into account the various factors. For evolving model guidelines, draft Model Guidelines regarding Environmental Aspect of Quarrying and of Minor Minerals was sent by a communication from the Ministry of Mines, calling for inputs. Accordingly, directions were issued to the Central and States Governments regarding compliance to the recommendations made by the Ministry in its report of March 2010 and the Model Guidelines framed by the Ministry of Mines.
27. By the Notification of 2016, an amendment was sought to be incorporated in the Notification of 2006 regarding preparation of DSR for sand mining or river bed mining and mining of other minor minerals. An elaborate procedure prescribed for preparation of DSR for sand mining or river bed mining and mining of other minor minerals\ has been given in Appendix X thereof.
Needless to state that the Notification of 2016 issued by the Ministry is binding on the State Government.
28. In view of the aforesaid background, after a declaration has been made by the State Government under sub-rule (1) of Rule 23 of the Rules, 2021, the District Officer is mandatorily required to get the area or areas so declared evaluated for quality and quantity of minerals for fixing the minimum bid or offer by the Director, Geology and Mining, Uttar Pradesh or by an officer authorised by him before the date fixed for e-tender/e-auction/e tender-cum-e auction. Such an evaluation is mandatory and has to be done after taking into account the various factors mentioned in Rule 10 of the Rules, 2021. The guidelines in the EMGSM-2020 for preparation of DSR are also factors for such evaluation.
29. As stated above, pre- & post- monsoon replenishment studies are mandated in the EMGSM-2020 guidelines and the same are an extension of the survey, demarcation and evaluation of the area or areas declared under Rule 23. The purpose of the survey and the evaluation that are requisites under the provisions of Chapter II and Chapter IV of the Rules, 2021 are to inform the prospective bidders at the auction/tender mining leases for minor minerals (sand and morrum in this case) so that the prospective bidders are well aware as to the quantity and quality of the minerals available in the declared area before they place their bids. The State Government cannot put the onus on the prospective bidders by stating that it is the bidders who should undertake an inspection of the area and satisfy themselves as to the quality and quantity of the minerals available at the area proposed to be leased, when the Rules, 2021 and the EMGSM-2020 guidelines require the State Government to undertake that exercise.
30. The guidelines contained in the SSMMG-2016 and in the EMGSM-2020 have been framed taking into account the judgments of the Supreme Court, the High Courts and the NGT. These guidelines appear to have been issued by the Central Government in purported exercise of power to issue directions under Section 20-A of the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 195714. The importance of the survey/evaluation by the State authorities in the interest of the ecology and environment in respect of the areas proposed to be leased under the Rules, 2021 cannot be over-emphasized. It is the only available and prescribed manner by which the State Government can make a realistic assessment as to the extent to which mining can be permitted in the leased area after taking into account the fragility of the ecology, the flora and fauna and the rivers, as well as the impact on the environment.
31. As mentioned above, both a pre-monsoon survey and a post-monsoon survey were got done by the petitioner as per the instructions received from the State authorities. Without getting the replenishment studies done, the petitioner could not re-commence mining operations. As a matter of fact, the petitioner had submitted a second post-monsoon replenishment study report on 8.1.2024 that reflected replenished minerals on the said lease as 16380 cubic meters. It was also stated in that replenishment study report that this mineral quantity may increase in future once water recedes down (sic). The State-respondents, in their counter affidavit, have sought to dismiss a replenishment study report by a baseless statement, in their counter affidavit, that analysis and conclusion of the replenishment study report dated 29.10.2023 that no mining activity can be done at all, is unworthy of being relied upon.
32. It is is not the case of the respondents that the replenishment studies that were got done by the petitioner were by an agency not accredited to NAPET/QCI, or that the agency was not empanelled as an Exploration Agency by the Department, or that the replenishment studies were made contrary to guidelines. It has also not been stated that the DSR/ evaluation for the leased area was available for being accessed by the petitioner. As a matter of fact the EMGSM-2020 guidelines reflect that often it is observed that letter of intent is granted for a location which has less potential for mining and not feasible for environment-friendly mining; that this leads to unnecessary financial burden on the mine owners and litigations; that thus, letter of intent should be preferably granted for those locations which have the least possibility of an impact on the environment and nearby habitation.
33. In the counter affidavit, the respondents have also stated that the petitioner could have surrendered the lease under the provisions of Rule 30 of the Rules, 2021 which it did not do. In our opinion, such objections and defences cannot be taken by the respondents to gloss over their inability in producing any evidence before this Court that a survey and evaluation was undertaken in respect of the area granted for mining lease to the petitioner and a DSR relating to the area of mining lease to the petitioner was made by the respondents in compliance of the Notification of 2016/SSMMG-2016 / EMGSM-2020 which DSR was accessible to the petitioner prior to submitting its bid.
34. Moreover, the notice of the Officer Incharge, Mines dated 2.6.2023 that is enclosed as Annexure No. 6 to the writ petition gives a categorical direction to the petitioner to get the requisite replenishment studies done and submit the same, failing which legal proceedings would be initiated against the petitioner. It is not demonstrated by the respondents that the petitioner did not intend to work the mines under the mining lease.
35. In paragraph 39 of the writ petition, the petitioner has stated that without the replenishment study report, no mining can be conducted in the mining area after monsoon and, moreover, the first post-monsoon replenishment study report clearly showed that the mining area was submerged.
Further, in paragraph 40 of the writ petition, it has been stated that the revisional authority as well as the District Magistrate had failed to consider that the quantity of mineral to be excavated during the period of lease is fixed by the State Government and the petitioner has no control over the quantity and, therefore, it is the State Government which fixes the quality and quantity to be excavated by the lease-holder during the period of lease.
36. In reply to the aforesaid paragraphs of the writ petitions, the respondents have referred to the statutory provisions referred elsewhere in the counter affidavit and the conditions of lease-deed as well as the obligation of the lease-holder to perform his part of the contract. It has been stated that the petitioner cannot change or alter the terms of the lease-deed according to his own convenience thereby causing loss to the State exchequer.
Moreover, this Court finds that in the reply, references have only been made to the Rule 29 of the Rules, 1963 and to Rule 30 of the Rules, 2021. Rule 29 of the Rules, 1963 deals with the execution of the lease-deed, while Section 30 of the Rules, 2021 deals with surrender of the mining lease. We fail to understand how this meets the submissions made on behalf of the petitioner. The respondents allege that the petitioner is trying to â€œwriggle out of a contract at his own mood swings, inasmuch as according to the own replenishment report to the petitioner at one place he says that no amount of sand is available for mining purposes and on the other hand in the second report estimates 16380 cubic meter is available for mining purposesâ€. Such a statement, in our opinion, is misplaced, uncalled for and without proper understanding of the EMGSM-2020.
37. In paragraph 44 of the writ petition, it is stated as follows:-
â€œ44.That, in the above-mentioned guidelines it was clearly stated that the object and purpose of DSR was to identify a minable area and thereby assessment of the minable quantity and quality of the minerals, which was supposed to be ascertained prior to the invitation to offer (E-auction/E-tender /Advertisement) which was not acted in compliance by the respondent authority.â€

38. In reply thereto, it has been stated in the counter affidavit as follows:-
â€œ32. That the averments made in paragraph no. 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49 and 50 of the writ petition are legal in nature and hence need no specific reply however it is humbly submitted that the said cases as cited by the petitioner are not applicable in the facts and circumstances of the present case and shall be duly distinguished at the time of hearing of the present writ petition. The principles laid down in the writ petition are based on mis-appreciation of facts and the legal principles and do not provide for and shall suitably been distinguished at the time of hearing of the present writ petition.â€

39. It is pertinent to mention here that it has not been stated in the counter affidavit filed by the respondents that any DSR was prepared after due survey and evaluation of the area sought to be auctioned. No DSR has been produced. Therefore, we cannot but conclude that the State Government has failed to demonstrate preparation of the DSR in due compliance of the Notification of 2016/SSMMG-2016 and EMGSM-2020 guidelines. Moreover, the respondents have openly rejected the first post-monsoon replenishment study report submitted by the petitioner without ascribing any cogent reason for such rejection.
40. The object of preparation of DSR is to ensure identification of areas of aggradation/deposition where mining can be allowed; identification of areas of erosion and proximity to infrastructural structures and installation where mining should be prohibited; and calculation of annual rate of replenishment and allowing time for replenishment after mining in the area. Thus, environmental protection requires strictly regulated mining in terms of area, quantity of mineral as well as, and very importantly, replenishment thereof.
41. The mining lease was granted in the land described in Part-I of the Schedule to the lease deed, in Village-Bilaspur Kachhar, Plot No.58 area 8.275 hectares for which the security amount was deposited. The boundaries of Plot No.58 are shown as follows:-
North - Remaining part of Plot No.58, river Yamuna
South - Border of Plot No.58 thereafter river Yamuna in village -Bichhavali
East - Remaining part of Plot No.58, thereafter agricultural land of Plot Nos.42 to 56 and Plot No.57
West - Remaining part of Plot No.58, river Yamuna
Though the map has not been enclosed alongwith the photocopy of the mining lease, it appears from the boundaries that mining area under the lease granted to the petitioner may include the river bed of the Yamuna river.
Given the EMGSM-2020 guidelines, it is not only the availability of mineral after its replenishment as would be reflected in the post monsoon replenishment study, but also the fact that at which part of the river bed/bank, has the replenishment occurred.
42. Thus, the annual audit envisaged under the aforesaid EMGSM-2020 guidelines and the replenishment study, both pre-monsoon and post-monsoon, assume great importance keeping in view the environment and ecology of the mining area. Mining within or near river-beds has a direct impact on the stream's physical characteristics, such as channel geometry, bed elevation, substratum composition and stability, in-stream roughness of the bed, flow velocity, discharge capacity, sediment transport capacity, turbidity, temperature etc. Alteration or modification of the above attributes may cause an impact on the ecological equilibrium of the riverine regime, disturbance in channel configuration and flow-paths. This may also cause an adverse impact on in-stream biota and riparian habitats. It is assumed that the riparian habitat disturbance is minimum if the replenishment is equal to excavation for a given stretch. Therefore, the EMGSM-2020 guidelines recommends that it is imperative to have a study of replenishment of material during the defined period to minimize the adverse impact arising out of sand mining in a given river stretch. The EMGSM-2020 guidelines provides that the excavation will be limited to estimated replenishment estimated with consideration of other regulatory provisions.
43. Therefore, the fact that the second post-monsoon replenishment study dated 8.1.2024 reflects replenishment of 16380 cubic meters of sand available for mining purpose has to be read in light of the location where this deposit/replenishment has taken place in the given river stretch. Then, it has to be ascertained in the light of EMGSM-2020, whether such replenishment is minable.
44. The respondents seem to be quite oblivious of the importance of proper replenishment, the mining plan and the DSR when they seek to raise demands and make claims without addressing the ecological concerns that are reflected in the EMGSM-2020 guidelines that also address the aspect of sustainable mining.
45. The respondents have sought to demonstrate the excavation of 85810 cubic meters of sand between January 2023 to June 2023 made by the petitioner during mining operations in the mining lease area only to seek to contend that the petitioner is short by 24247 cubic meters of the total mining of 110057 cubic meters permissible per annum under the terms of the lease which can be made good by the petitioner once the water level of the recedes down. However, such an assertion is made on the presumption that adequate replenishment will take place in the area, without due regard to the ecological aspects that require consideration during mining operations and thereafter as reflected in the EMGSM-2020 guidelines.
46. In case no adequate replenishment takes place even after water of river recedes down, then any advance payment of installments by the petitioner would result in serious loss to it which eventuality is neither contemplated in the lease deed nor in the Rules, 2021. Therefore the contention sought to be made that payment of installment should be made by the petitioner and eMM-11 forms be uploaded to the extent of carried forward quantity of minerals which could not have been mined in the preceding months till March 2024, is fallacious.
47. There appears to be an effort to extract revenue from mining operations for benefit of the State exchequer without empathy and consideration of ecology, and sustainable mining, which aspects have to be balanced with the imperatives of development and earnings for the State exchequer.
48. No doubt, there is a contract, the lease-deed, entered into between the respondents and the petitioner, the terms of which bind them both. However, the terms of the lease-deed cannot override the aforesaid Notification of 2016, the SSMMG-2016, EMGSM-2020 guidelines and the Act and Rules.
49. It is pertinent to mention here that in the counter affidavit, the respondents harp on the availability of 16380 cubic meter of replenished sand and that the second replenishment study report reflects that after water recedes in the post-monsoon season, the mineral quantity may increase in future once the water recedes down.
Apart from the fact that this statement in the counter affidavit is based upon without fully appreciating the opinion expressed in the post monsoon replenishment study conducted on 8.1.2024 which also stated that no significant replenishment of RBM was found as no turbulent flooding was observed in that year, the post monsoon replenishment study on 29.10.2023 reflects that the entire leased area was submerged under active stream of river Yamuna and a very small patch of surface was seen which belonged to the replenished area. It was highly recommended that the lease holder shall await receding of water for further survey. Whereafter the leased area could be re-investigated for DGPS data in order to establish replenished sand minerals. It was, therefore, stated that mining activity was, therefore, not feasible in compliance of the recommendation of SSMMG-2016.
50. Due and timely payment of installments under the terms of a mining lease is based on winning existing minerals for which the lease is granted which corresponds to the quality and quantity contemplated in the DSR and the replenishment studies, particularly, the post-monsoon replenishment study. If the post-monsoon replenishment study does not reflect adequate replenishment in the manner and to the extent envisaged in the EMGSM-2020, no mining can be permitted in the area pertaining to the mining lease. As a corollary, for want of adequate replenishment of the mineral or non-availability of mineral in the requisite quantity in various other parts of the area for which lease has been granted, neither can any mining activity be permitted nor, consequently, can any claim for installments be sustained unless there is actual replenishment or availability. It is for these circumstances that preparation of proper DSR and conducting audit assumes importance.
51. In the aforesaid background, we find that the case of the petitioner has merit. The petitioner could not have been forced to mine the relatively meagre amount of 16380 cubic meters of replenished sand that was reflected in the last replenishment study report submitted by the petitioner without ascertaining whether the replenishment that had taken place in the stretch of land/river was such that mining of the same could be permitted in the backdrop of sustainable mining. There is no DSR shown to have been prepared.
52. As far as filing of Writ-C No.9186 of 2022 by the petitioner before the Lucknow Bench of this Court is concerned, the same is for a different cause of action. However, the petitionerâ€™s choosing both the Lucknow Bench of this Court as well as at Allahabad to file different petitions, is not proper. Be that as it may.
53. For the reasons aforesaid, the impugned orders dated 18.4.2024, 27.2.2024 and 19.2.2024 cannot be sustained and are hereby quashed.
54. However, since, by means of an affidavit filed alongwith a stay application on 9.12.2024, we are informed that steps have been taken by the State Government for fresh auction of the mining area that was granted to the petitioner, we direct that the petitioner is not liable to deposit any installment after the stoppage of mining operations for the period from 1.7.2023 onwards. If any amount has been deposited/recovered/confiscated by/against the petitioner, the same shall be refunded within a period of one month from today alongwith simple interest @ 9% per annum calculated from the date of such deposit/recovery/confiscation till the actual payment.
55. Subject to the aforesaid observations, this writ petition is allowed.
56. However, before parting, we deem it fit to direct the respondents to ensure preparation of DSR in respect of every area sought to be auctioned for mining of sand/gravel/morrum in compliance of the Notification of 2006, as amended by the Notification of 2016, the SSMMG-2016 and EMGSM-2020.

Hon'ble Kshitij Shailendra,J.
EFFECT OF MOTOR VEHICLES (AMENDMENT) ACT, 2019 (32 of 2019) ON INSURERâ€™S RIGHT TO RECOVER COMPENSATION FROM OWNER
1. Heard Shri Aditya Singh Parihar, learned counsel for the appellant-Insurance Company, Shri S.D. Ojha, and Shri Shreesh Srivastava, learned counsel for the claimant-respondents and Shri Abhinav Trivedi as well as Shri Adarsh Kumar, learned counsel for vehicle owner and driver in all the connected appeals.
2. All these appeals involve common questions of fact and law and, hence, are being decided by a common judgment. For the sake of convenience, First Appeal From Order No. 1780 of 2024 shall be treated as leading case.
3. The present appeal at the instance of Insurance Company challenges the award dated 01.06.2024, whereby the Presiding Officer, Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Kanpur Dehat has allowed M.A.C. No. 186 of 2022 (Smt. Aarti Devi and others vs. Manager I.C.I.C.I. Lombard General Insurance Company Limited and others) in part awarding a sum of Rs.20,11,800/- towards compensation against the owner and driver of the offending vehicle with an observation that vehicle being insured with the appellant-Company, the appellant shall have right to recover the amount of compensation from the owner and the driver. Initial liability to pay compensation has been fastened upon the appellant-Insurance Company.
4. Brief facts giving rise to the instant appeal are that a road accident took place on 29.05.2022 in which one Pradeep Kumar, who was sitting in Eco Car No. U.P. 90 U-9831, suffered injuries and succumbed to the same on the spot. The accident was caused by Bus No. U.P. 77 T-5052, which was insured with the appellant-Insurance Company. A claim petition was filed by the legal representatives of the deceased claiming compensation. The Tribunal, after framing issues as regards rash and negligent driving of the bus driver and the car driver and as to whether the drivers were having valid driving license on the date of accident, factum of insurance and liability to pay compensation by which party and to what extent, decided the claim petition by the impugned judgment and order.
5. When the appeal came up for consideration on the first date, this Court, after noting down submissions advanced by the appellant including a legal plea raised in the light of omission of proviso to sub-section (4) of Section 149 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (herein after referred to as Act, 1988) by way of Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019 (32 of 2019), admitted the appeal on 27.09.2024 and issued notices to the unrepresented respondents. After the parties were represented, the Court, by an order dated 08.11.2024, summoned the record of the Tribunal. The appeal was heard at length on 09.01.2025 and judgment was reserved.
THE LEGAL ISSUE INVOLVED
6. The decision in these appeals raises a very significant question of law in the light of Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019 (32 of 2019) and not yet decided in India, as informed to the Court. Vide notification dated 25.02.2022 issued in exercise of powers under Section 1(2) of the Amending Act, 2019, various sections including Section 51 of the Amending Act came into force w.e.f. 01.04.2022. It is Section 51 that replaces Chapter XI of the Act of 1988 by a new Chapter XI that is relevant for the instant case. When read with Section 166 (3) of the Act where limitation to present a claim petition within 6 months from the occurrence of accident has been prescribed, it infers that the provisions of newly substituted Chapter XI would deal with cases arising from accidents taking place after 01.04.2022. The question is as to whether mere omission of proviso attached to sub-section (4) of Section 149 of Act, 1988 after its replacement by Section 150 by Amendment Act, 2019 would mean that the liability of the insurer to pay and its right to recover the amount from the owner has been taken away and does not survive in relation to accidents occurring after 01.04.2022.
ARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF INSURER
7. Learned counsel for the appellant has vehemently argued that since the accident took place after coming into force of the Amendment Act, the Tribunal was not justified in issuing a direction to the appellant to pay compensation to the claimants with a right to recover. Elaborating his submissions, it is urged that Insurance Companyâ€™s right to recover compensation from the owner of the offending vehicle flows from the proviso attached to sub-section (4) of Section 149 of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, however, the said proviso has been omitted by Act of 2019 and, therefore, in case of a breach of policy, it is only the owner against whom award can be directly made and Insurer is liable to be relieved from any liability to indemnify the owner. It is further submitted that language used in the statute being plain and simple, nothing can be read which the statute does not contain and, hence, earlier judgments laying down proposition to first pay compensation to the claimants and then have right to recover the same from the owner, would have no application as in none of the authorities so far, the effect of amendments made by the Act of 2019 has been examined. Entire Chapter XI of the Act of 1988 has been replaced by new Chapter XI and in place of Section 149 of the Act of 1988, Section 150 has been substituted, which does not contain any provision/proviso as was earlier attached to sub-section (4) giving right to the Insurer to recover the amount in case of breach of policy. Placing reliance upon Statement of Objects and Reasons behind enactment of Act of 2019, it is urged that after considering numerous representations and recommendations in the form of grievances and suggestions from various stake-holders, legislature has, in its wisdom, brought into existence the Amendment Act to minimize road accidents and disregard traffic rules and regulations and to improve road safety and transport system. There is flood of cases where either fake claims are raised or the claimants collude with the owners of the offending vehicle and proceed in such a manner so that ultimately, though breach of insurance policy is found, liability to pay compensation at the first instance is enforced against the Insurance Company, knowing well that ownerâ€™s role would come into picture when the recovery is issued against him by which time the claimants would have been compensated and a situation would arise where for years together, owners would remain absolved of liability.
8. Elaborating his submissions, it is urged by Shri Parihar as under:-
(a) Section 149 (4) and amended provision section 150 (4) reflect that the unamended section 149 (2) provided two defences to the Insurance Co.:
i. Case of breach of policy mentioned section 149 (2)(a) of the Act and
ii. policy being void as per section 149 (2) (b) of the Act.
(b) The unamended provision laid down that except under the situation provided by section 149 (2)(b), the insurer would not be in a position to avoid the liability because it has got right against the owner under the above provision. So, in a situation of breach of policy as provided u/s 149 (2)(a), the Insurance Co. would be held liable and it can recover the same in light of the proviso to Section 149(4).
(c) The amended Section 150 (2) provides three defences to the Insurance Co.:
i. Case of breach of policy-mentioned u/s 150 (2)(a) of the Act,
ii. Policy being void as per sec. 150 (2)(b) of the Act, and
iii. Non-receipt of premium.
(d) The amended provision, i.e. Section 150(4) provides that except under the situations provided by S.150(2), the insurer would not be in a position to avoid the liability. Meaning thereby that if the case falls under any of the defences reflected in Section 150(2) of the Act, the Insurer can avoid the liability.
(e) All the earlier precedents lose their precedential value as they relate to earlier unamended provision and, hence, do not contemplate the new amended provision and its implication. If the arguments of claimants are accepted that even after deletion of proviso by way of amendment Act, Insurance Company would be liable to pay compensation, permitting it to raise grounds of challenge would be a redundant provision and in no case, defence of Insurance Company would be entertainable.
(f) The power under Article 142 of the Constitution of India is in the exclusive domain of the Apex Court and can be exercised by the Apex Court alone to serve the ends of justice in the peculiar facts and circumstances of a case. Hence all the judgements of the Hon'ble Supreme Court invoking its power under Article 142 of the Constitution of India cannot be relied upon.
(g) The leading judgment in relation to Insurance Companyâ€™s right to recover from the owner, i.e., National Insurance Company Limited vs. Swaran Singh and others, JT 2004 (1) SC 109, was pronounced when the proviso to sub-section (4) of Section 149 existed in the Statute Book and the matter before the Supreme Court had arisen out of interpretation of Section 149 vis-a-vis the proviso and once the proviso does not find place after amendment, any law laid down by the Supreme Court or this Court would not be read in relation to those cases where accident took place after the Amendment Act has come into operation.
(h) The doctrine of â€œStare decisisâ€ directs courts to follow prior decisions of higher courts when resolving cases involving similar facts and law. The argument of the respondents and the judgments relied upon by them presented as examples of stare decisis suggesting that insurers cannot avoid liability and that 'Pay and Recover' still remains where liability is disputed, hold no ground as they are based on the now-deleted provisions of the Act, 1988.
(i) The amendments in Act are prospective in nature and, hence, the mandate of Swaran Singh's case would hold ground for all cases wherein the occurrence of accident predates the coming into force of the amendment, i.e. 1.4.2022, but not otherwise.
(j) It is a trite law that primary rule of interpretation/ construction is that the intention of the legislature must be found in the words used by the legislature itself. The Hon'ble Apex Court, in the case of Satheedevi vs Prasanna, (2010) 5 SCC 622, has held that if the words used are capable of one construction only then it would not be open to the courts to adopt any other hypothetical construction on the ground that such hypothetical construction is more consistent with the alleged object and policy of the Act. The words used in the material provisions of the statute must be interpreted in their plain grammatical meaning and it is only when such words are capable of two constructions that the question of giving effect to the policy or object of the Act can legitimately arise.
(k) In the case of Union of India vs. Deoki Nandan Aggarwal,1991 AIR SCW 2754, the Hon'ble Apex Court has held that court cannot rewrite recast or reframe the legislation. A court cannot add words to a statute or read words which are not there in it. Even if there is a defect or an omission in the statute, the court cannot correct the defect or supply the omission.
(l) The Supreme Court has upheld the Causus Omissus maxim in several judgments, explicitly stating that such omissions cannot be addressed by judicial interpretation. In M/s Unique Butyle Tube Industries Pvt. Ltd. vs. UP Financial Corporation and Others, AIR 2003 SC 2103, it was held that the legislature's omissions (if any) cannot be filled by judicial interpretation. If a statute leaves out a particular situation, the courts cannot insert words to address that omission. In such a circumstance, reading something into a provision when the legislature in its wisdom has specifically omitted, deleted or repealed a provision or its part, would amount to doing violence to the statute and the same should not be done to the clear and plain language of the statute.
(m) Even laws that are beneficial must follow the constraints of statutory language ensuring a balance between legislative intent and literal interpretation The principle that "the law is what the text says" underlines court judgments. While beneficial legislation plays an important role, it cannot override the clear and specific language of statutes as drafted by the legislature. The court cannot go beyond the framework established by the legislature.
9. In support of his submissions, learned counsel for the appellant has placed reliance upon the following authorities:-
(1) New India Assurance Co., Shimla vs. Kamla and others, 2001(4) SCC 342
(2) National Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Swaran Singh and others, JT 2004 (1) SC 109
(3) S. Iyyapan vs. United India Insurance Co. Ltd. And another, 2013 (7) SCC 62
(4) M/s Unique Butyle Tube Industries Pvt. Ltd. vs. U.P. Financial Corporation and others, AIR 2003 SC 2103
(5) Satheedevi vs. Prasanna and another, 2010 (5) SCC 622
(6) Union of India vs. Deoki Nandan Aggarwal, 1991 AIR SCW 2754
(7) ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Suresh and 2 others, 2024 (2) ADJ 576.
ARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF CLAIMANTS AND OWNER
10. Per contra, learned counsel for the claimants-respondents as well as owner and driver of offending vehicle submit as under:-
(a) Amendments incorporated by the Act of 2019 would not absolve the liability of the Insurer to first pay compensation and irrespective of deletion of proviso to sub-section (4) of Section 149 by virtue of newly substituted Section 150, the Insurer shall have to pay compensation and right to recover compensation so paid from the owner would still remain intact.
(b) Requirements of issuance of insurance policy and limiting liability as per section 147 of Act of 1988 has to be read in the light of various sub-sections especially sub-section (1) (a), (b) and (5) thereof and a conjoint reading of the said provision with the previous sub-section (4) in Section 149 and newly substituted sub-section (4) of Section 150 would reveal that there is no change as far as indemnifying the owner of the vehicle by the Insurance Company is concerned.
(c) Even as on today, the Supreme Court has passed certain judgments whereby right to recover has been given to the Insurance Company and considering the fact that the Act is a beneficial legislation having benevolent object, the argument of Insurance Company that the award has to be made against the owner and the Insurance Company has to be completely freed from indemnifying the owner cannot be accepted.
(d) Claimants being dependents of the deceased or themselves injured would not be in a position to recover the amount from the owner of the vehicle and, therefore, keeping in view the object of the Act, immediate compensation has to be paid to the claimants by the Insurance Company.
(e) If the Insurance Company keeps on issuing insurance policy and renew it without examining the requirements such as existence of a valid driving license or permit or other such components, in case breach of policy comes into light during the course of proceedings before Tribunal, the Company being at fault, it cannot absolve itself from liability to pay compensation and then recover from the owner.
(f) Despite replacement of Section 149 by substituted Section 150, liability of Insurance Company to indemnify the risk as provided under Section 147(5) of the Act of 1988 prior to amendment has not been taken away, rather the said sub-section has now been reintroduced as sub-section (6) of the Act after amendment and, therefore, liability of Insurance Company to first pay the amount to the claimants does not vanish.
(g) Insurance policy is a contract between insurer and the owner and third party being alien to the contract, in case of breach of policy, claimants cannot suffer and beneficial legislation and object behind it containing provision of indemnifying the risk would stand frustrated if mere non-inclusion of proviso in sub-section (4) of Section 150 is interpreted to absolve the Insurance Company to first pay the amount to the claimants.
11. In support of their submissions, reliance has been placed upon the following authorities:-
(1) Praveenbhai S. Khambhayata vs. United India Insurance Company Ltd. & others 2015 (11) SCC 417

(2) No sum shall be payable by an insurer under sub-section (1) in respect of any judgment or award unless, before the commencement of the proceedings in which the judgment or award is given the insurer had notice through the court or, as the case may be, the Claims Tribunal of the bringing of the proceedings, or in respect of such judgment or award so long as its execution is stayed pending an appeal; and an insurer to whom notice of the bringing of any such proceedings is so given shall be entitled to be made a party thereto, and to defend the action on any of the following grounds, namely:â€”
(a) that there has been a breach of a specified condition of the policy, being one of the following conditions, namely:â€“â€“
(i) a condition excluding the use of the vehicleâ€”
(A) for hire or reward, where the vehicle is on the date of the contract of insurance a vehicle not covered by a permit to ply for hire or reward; or
(B) for organised racing and speed testing; or
(C) for a purpose not allowed by the permit under which the vehicle is used, where the vehicle is a transport vehicle; or
(D) without side-car being attached where the vehicle is a two-wheeled vehicle; or
(ii) a condition excluding driving by a named person or by any person who is not duly licenced or by any person who has been disqualified for holding or obtaining a driving licence during the period of disqualification or driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs as laid down in section 185; or
(iii) a condition excluding liability for injury caused or contributed to by conditions of war, civil war, riot or civil commotion; or
(b) that the policy is void on the ground that it was obtained by nondisclosure of any material fact or by representation of any fact which was false in some material particular; or
(c) that there is non-receipt of premium as required under section 64VB of the Insurance Act, 1938.
(3) â€¦â€¦â€¦...
(4) Where a certificate of insurance has been issued under sub-section (3) of section 147 to the person by whom a policy has been effected, so much of the policy as purports to restrict the insurance of the persons insured thereby, by reference to any condition other than those in sub- section (2) shall, as respects such liabilities as are required to be covered by a policy under clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 147, be of no effect.
FEW AUTHORITIES ON COMPULSORY INSURANCE
13. The Supreme Court, in United India Insurance Company Limited v. Santro Devi and Ors., (2009) 1 SCC 558 observed that the provisions of compulsory insurance have been framed to advance a social object. It is in a way part of the social justice doctrine. When a certificate of insurance is issued, in law, the insurance company is bound to reimburse the owner. There cannot be any doubt whatsoever that a contract of insurance must fulfill the statutory requirements of formation of a valid contract but in case of a third- party risk, the question has to be considered from a different angle. It was further held that section 146 of the Act gives complete protection to Third Party in respect of death or bodily injury or damage to the property while using the vehicle in public place. For that purpose, insurance of the vehicle has been made compulsory to the vehicles or to the owners. This would further reflect that compulsory insurance is obviously for the benefit of Third Parties. The judgment in Santro Devi (supra) was followed by Supreme Court in Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation vs. Kulsum and other, 2011 (8) SCC 142.
14. In G. Govindan vs. New India Assurance Co. Ltd. and others, 1999 (3) SCC 754, the Supreme Court, dealing with mandatory requirement of statute governing insurance qua third party risks, observed in paragraph Nos. 12, 13 and 15 as under:-
â€œ12. The heading of Chapter VIII of the old Act reads as "Insurance of Motor Vehicles against Third Party Risks". A perusal of the provisions under Chapter VIII makes it clear that the Legislature made insurance of motor vehicles compulsory against third-party (victims) risks. This Court in New Asiatic Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Pessumal Dhanamal Aswani & Ors., AIR (1964) SC 1736 after noticing the compulsory nature of insurance against third- party observed that once the company had undertaken liability to third parties incurred by the persons specified in the policy, the third parties' right to recover any amount under or by virtue of the provisions of the Act is not affected by any condition in the policy.
13. In our opinion that both under the old act and under the new Act the Legislature was anxious to protect the third party (victim) interest. It appears that what was implicit in the provisions of the old Act is now made explicit, presumably in view of the conflicting decisions on this aspect among the various High Courts.
15. As between the two conflicting views of the full bench judgments noticed above, we prefer to approve the ratio laid down by the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Kondaiah's case (Madineni Kondaiah v. Yaseen Fatima: AIR 1986 AP 62) as it advances the object of the Legislature to protect the third party interest. We hasten to add that the third party here will not include a transferee whose transferor has not followed procedure for transfer of policy. In other words in accord with the well- settled rule of interpretation of statutes we are inclined to hold that the view taken by the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Kondaiah's case is preferable to the contrary views taken by the Karnataka (National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Mallikarjun: AIR 1990 Kant 166) and Delhi (Anand Sarup Sharma v. P.P. Khurana: 1989 ACJ 577 (Del) (FB) High Courts (supra) even assuming that two views are possible on the interpretation of relevant sections as it promotes the object of the Legislature in protecting the third party (victim) interest. The ratio laid down in the judgment of Karnataka & Delhi High Courts (supra) differing from Andhra Pradesh High Court is not the correct one.â€
LEADING AUTHORITIES ON â€˜PAY AND RECOVERâ€™
15. In Kamla (supra), the Supreme Court dealt with the then existing Chapter XI of the Act of 1988 and held as under:-
â€œ21. A reading of the proviso to sub-section (4) as well as the language employed in sub-section (5) would indicate that they are intended to safeguard the interest of an insurer who otherwise has no liability to pay any amount to the insured but for the provisions contained in Chapter XI of the Act. This means, the insurer has to pay to the third parties only on account of the fact that a policy of insurance has been issued in respect of the vehicle, but the insurer is entitled to recover any such sum from the insured if the insurer were not otherwise liable to pay such sum to the insured by virtue of the conditions of the contract of insurance indicated by the policy.
22. To repeat, the effect of the above provisions is this: When a valid insurance policy has been issued in respect of a vehicle as evidenced by a certificate of insurance the burden is on the insurer to pay to third parties, whether or not there has been any breach or violation of the policy conditions. But the amount so paid by the insurer to third parties can be allowed to be recovered from the insured if as per the policy conditions the insurer had no liability to pay such sum to the insured.â€
16. Indisputably, the Supreme Court in Kamla (supra), Swaran Singh (supra) and other judgments cited on that line was dealing with unamended provisions which, had not come into light by that time as the amending Act was enacted in 2019. First paragraph of Swaran Singh (supra) reads as under:-
â€œInterpretation of Section 149(2)(a)(ii) vis-a-vis the proviso appended to sub-sections (4) and (5) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 is involved in this batch of special leave petitions filed by the National Insurance Company Limited (hereinafter referred to as Insurer) assailing various awards of the Motor Vehicle Claims Tribunal and judgments of the High Courts.â€
The relevant ratio of Swaran Singh (supra) in the form of summary of findings is as under:-
â€œ108. The summary of our findings to the various issues as raised in these petitions are as follows:
(i) Chapter XI of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 providing compulsory insurance of vehicles against third party risks is a social welfare legislation to extend relief by compensation to victims of accidents caused by use of motor vehicles. The provisions of compulsory insurance coverage of all vehicles are with this paramount object and the provisions of the Act have to be so interpreted as to effectuate the said object.
(ii) ...............................
(iii) The breach of policy condition e.g., disqualification of driver or invalid driving licence of the driver, as contained in sub-section (2)(a)(ii) of section 149, have to be proved to have been committed by the insured for avoiding liability by the insurer. Mere absence, fake or invalid driving licence or disqualification of the driver for driving at the relevant time, are not in themselves defences available to the insurer against either the insured or the third parties. To avoid its liability towards insured, the insurer has to prove that the insured was guilty of negligence and failed to exercise reasonable care in the matter of fulfilling the condition of the policy regarding use of vehicles by duly licensed driver or one who was not disqualified to drive at the relevant time.
(iv) The insurance companies are, however, with a view to avoid their liability must not only establish the available defence(s) raised in the said proceedings but must also establish 'breach' on the part of the owner of the vehicle; the burden of proof wherefor would be on them.
(v) ..............................
(vi) Even where the insurer is able to prove breach on the part of the insured concerning the policy condition regarding holding of a valid licence by the driver or his qualification to drive during the relevant period, the insurer would not be allowed to avoid its liability towards insured unless the said breach or breaches on the condition of driving licence is/ are so fundamental as are found to have contributed to the cause of the accident. The Tribunals in interpreting the policy conditions would apply "the rule of main purpose" and the concept of "fundamental breach" to allow defences available to the insured under section 149(2) of the Act.
(vii) .............................
(viii) ............................
(ix) ..............................
(x) Where on adjudication of the claim under the Act the tribunal arrives at a conclusion that the insurer has satisfactorily proved its defence in accordance with the provisions of section 149(2) read with sub-section (7), as interpreted by this Court above, the Tribunal can direct that the insurer is liable to be reimbursed by the insured for the compensation and other amounts which it has been compelled to pay to the third party under the award of the tribunal. Such determination of claim by the Tribunal will be enforceable and the money found due to the insurer from the insured will be recoverable on a certificate issued by the tribunal to the Collector in the same manner under Section 174 of the Act as arrears of land revenue. The certificate will be issued for the recovery as arrears of land revenue only if, as required by sub-section (3) of Section 168 of the Act the insured fails to deposit the amount awarded in favour of the insurer within thirty days from the date of announcement of the award by the tribunal.
(xi) â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦...
17. The Court, in the light of judicial precedents referred above, now proceeds to deal with the object of the Act, spirit of relevant provisions, both before and after amendments and to answer the core question involved.
18. Section 147 of the Act, after amendment, remains unchanged except renumbering of one or the other sub-section. According to it, a policy of insurance insures the person or classes of persons specified in the policy to the extent specified in sub-section (2) against any liability which may be incurred by him in respect of the death of or bodily injury to any person including owner of the goods or his authorised representative carried in the motor vehicle or damage to any property of a third party caused by or arising out of the use of the motor vehicle in a public place; against the death of or bodily injury to any passenger of a transport vehicle, except gratuitous passengers of a goods vehicle, caused by or arising out of the use of the motor vehicle in a public place. It is, therefore, apparent that insurance policy covers third party risks in case of death of or of bodily injury.
19. Sub-section (2) of Section 149, before amendment, contemplates grounds on which an Insurance Company can defend its liability to pay compensation and one of the grounds is that there has been a breach of specified condition of the policy. The conditions have also been specifically enumerated. The question is as to whether in a case of breach of policy, the Insurance Company would be liable to pay compensation or to indemnify the owner at the first instance and as to whether right to recover is still available available to the insurer.
20. It is clear that when conditions other than those mentioned in clause (b) of sub-section (2) of Section 149 exist, the policy shall be of no effect. In such event, though the sum is initially payable by the insurer towards discharge of liability covered by the policy, the same shall be recoverable by the insurer from the person, who is actually liable to pay compensation, i.e. owner of the offending vehicle. The substituted Section 150 does not contain any such provision giving right of recovery. As a matter of fact the proviso has been omitted and sub-section (2) of Section 150 clearly lays down that Insurance Company can defend the action on any of the grounds mentioned therein which include breach of a specified condition of the policy, specifying the conditions of breach also.
21. When the language used in sub-Section (4) of Section 149 prior to amendment as replaced by sub-Section (4) of Section 150 by the Amendment Act of 2019, is carefully examined, the words â€œshall, as respects such liabilities as are required to be covered by a policy under clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 147, be of no effectâ€ would only mean that under the circumstances covered by sub-Section (4), either of Section 149 or Section 150, the insurer would be well within its rights to avoid liability flowing from the insurance policy. Meaning thereby that the insurer would be absolved of bearing liability to pay compensation to the claimants. It does not mean that the insurer would also be absolved from its liability to indemnify the ownerâ€™s risk. Such indemnification will still continue to remain alive and the insurer shall have to first pay the compensation through indemnification and, then, it shall have a right to recover from the owner the amount paid as the ultimate liability shall have to be borne by the owner and not by insurer. In such an event, there would be no financial loss to the insurer as it would be compensated through recovery from the owner. The aforesaid provisions are expressly to give defence to the insurer and have to be read to that extent only and not to interpret as if the liability to indemnify stands washed away. It therefore follows that even if the proviso to sub-Section (4) would not have been there before the amendment, the indemnification concept would have still remained alive and operative and, hence, mere omission of the proviso by the Amendment Act of 2019 would be of no avail.
22. Therefore, when Shri Parihar urges that if, in every case, liability to pay compensation has to be borne by the Insurance Company, there would be no effect of providing grounds for defence either under sub-section (2) of the Act prior to amendment or under sub-section (2) of the Act after amendment, this Court finds no force in the submission. The reason is that providing grounds of defence under the said provisions would be read so as to give an opportunity to the Insurance Company to avoid passing of award against it, i,e, holding it liable to bear the award. The said liability to have an award against the Insurance Company is distinct from the situation where award is against the owner and insurer is made liable to pay compensation to the claimants and then recover the same from the owner. Non-receipt of premium as required under Section 64(V)B of the Insurance Act, 1938 has now been added in Section 150(2). It reflects that even in a case where premium is not received by the Insurance Company, it can raise a ground of challenge so as to avoid passing of award against it and, in that event also, award would be drawn against the owner. When payment or non-payment of premium is significant after amendment and has been made a ground of defence, the Court observes that a third party risk is covered under the policy which is a contract and premium qua third party risk is received by the insurer in relation to the contract. Therefore, policy continues to subsist to cover third party risk so long the premium is received and non-payment thereof would absolve the Insurance Company from its liability of an award being passed against it.
CONCEPT OF 'PAY AND RECOVER'
23. To better understand as to whether 'PAY AND RECOVER' aspect is still left after amendment, words â€œany sum paid by the insurer in or towards the discharge of any liability of any person which is covered by the policyâ€ used in proviso attached to section 149(4) need to be read and understood with great caution. The words used are â€œpaid by the insurerâ€ and not â€œpayable by the insurerâ€. There is a distinction between â€œpaidâ€ and â€œpayableâ€ as per the scheme of the Act. The sum shall become payable by the insurer when the award is passed against it holding it liable to bear the award on its shoulders for all time to come without any further shift in such liability. The proviso existed earlier gives the insurer a right to recover the amount from the owner which has been paid by it and not payable by it.
24. Award is made under Section 168 of the Act. Sub section (3) of Section 168 reads as under:-.
â€œ168 â€“ Award of the Claims Tribunal-

(3) When an award is made under this section, the person who is required to pay any amount in terms of such award shall, within thirty days of the date of announcing the award by the Claims Tribunal, deposit the entire amount awarded in such manner as the Claims Tribunal may direct.â€
Words â€œa person who is required to pay any amount in terms of such awardâ€ mentioned in sub-section (3) of Section 168 not only mean a person who has to finally satisfy the award but also include a person, who has been directed to pay any amount in terms of the award. The said person may also be insurer and that is why whenever the insurer is directed to pay any amount in terms of award and the right of recovery is also given to it, the insurer has to deposit the amount before the Tribunal within thirty days. In such situation, it does not mean that if the insurer deposits the amount, its right to recover stands vanished, rather such right is specifically conferred upon the insurer under the award itself. The said provision does not mean that it is the liability of the Insurance Company to bear the award for all time to come but it only means that it has to pay the amount only for transitional period and the chapter is not closed forever as the right to recover is very much there. The award has to be read as a whole and not in piece-meal.
25. The Court cannot overlook an aspect that Section 147(5) of the Act, prior to amendment has been replaced by Section 147(6) of the Act after amendment but there are no qualifying words referable to section 150. Sub-section (6) of section 147 reads as under:-
â€œ(6) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, an insurer issuing a policy of insurance under this section shall be liable to indemnify the person or classes of persons specified in the policy in respect of any liability which the policy purports to cover in the case of that person or those classes of persons.â€
From renumbering of the sub-section, as above, it follows that once the liability to indemnify the person specified in the policy, as per sub-section (6) of Section 147, even after amendment, continues to exist in the Statute book and it excludes applicability of any other law for the time being in force, indemnification by the insurer does not vanish even after amendments incorporated by the Act of 2019. The right to recover the amount paid to the claimants as per conditions mentioned in section 150 would still be available to the insurer as indemnification has not been taken away by the legislature nor has it been explained by adding words to section 147 or anywhere else.
26. This Court also finds that since the contract of insurance is between insurer and the owner and has no concern with the claimants who are in fact victims of the accident, language used in Section 149 (prior to amendment) and Section 150 (after amendment) would show that notwithstanding the fact that the insurer may be entitled to avoid or cancel the policy on account of breach of terms thereof, it shall pay to the person entitled to the benefit of the award. Therefore, whether Insurance Company cancels or does not cancel an insurance policy, the same has nothing to do with the claimants and they are entitled to get the amount from insurer. It means that claimants' right to receive compensation from the insurer at the first instance is unaffected by the inter-se rights and liabilities arising out of contract between the insurer and the owner.
27. Words â€œno sum shall be payable by the insurer under sub-section (1)â€ used either in Section 149 of the Act of 1988 (prior to amendment) in Section 150 (after amendment) would mean that if the grounds of defence set-forth in sub-section (2) of Section 149 or Section 150, as the case may be, exist, no sum shall be payable by the insurer. It does not mean that the sum shall not be paid by the insurer if the award contains a direction to the insurer to pay and recover. Liability to pay the amount has to be segregated from actual payment made by the insurer in case of survival and existence of insurance policy issued under Section 147 of the Act. Word â€œliabilityâ€ has to be understood as the â€œfinal liability to bear the award for all time to comeâ€ separate from concept of indemnification by the insurer by making immediate payment.

28. Whenever a claim petition is decided by the Tribunal, thirty daysâ€™ time is granted under section 168(3) by the Tribunal for depositing the amount, failing which recovery proceedings in terms of Section 174 of the Act would be initiated. Section 174 is quoted for a ready reference:-
â€œ174. Recovery of money from insurer as arrear of land revenue.â€”Where any amount is due from any person under an award, the Claims Tribunal may, on an application made to it by the person entitled to the amount, issue a certificate for the amount to the Collector and the Collector shall proceed to recover the same in the same manner as an arrear of land revenue.â€
Certainly, recovery as arrears of land revenue in the State of U.P. would then be ensured as per Chapter X of the Uttar Pradesh Zamindari Abolition & Land Reforms Rules, 1952. Now suppose Tribunal issues a recovery certificate on account of non-deposit of amount by the insurer in terms of the award towards indemnification and if, during the period of limitation for filing the appeal under Section 173 of the Act, the insurer approaches the High Court where on one or the other ground, an interim order is passed, the insurer, in almost all cases, barring few exceptions, is put to financial terms in such a way that the claimants get some financial relief even during the pendency of appeal. This is done as per the legislative mandate contained under sub-Rule (5) of Rule 5 of Order XLI of the Code of Civil Procedure (as applicable in the State of U.P.), which reads as under:-
â€œ(5) Notwithstanding anything contained in the foregoing sub-rules where the appeal is against the decree for payment of money, the Appellate Court shall not make an order staying the execution of the decree, unless the appellant shall, within such time as the Appellate Court may allow, deposit the amount disputed in the appeal or furnish such security in respect thereof as the Appellate Court may think fit.â€

29. Therefore, when the provisions of the Act of 1988 are read with C.P.C., it becomes clear that as soon as an award is passed, the claimants become entitled to get the amount of compensation and they get financial relief even during the pendency of the appeal filed by the insurer.
30. At this juncture, this Court also thinks it appropriate to make a reference of the Statement of Objects and Reasons behind introducing the Amendment Act, 2019. The relevant clauses of the same are quoted hereunder:-
Statement of Objects and Reasons
â€œThe Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (the Act), was enacted with a view to consolidate and amend the laws relating to motor vehicles. The Act was enacted to give effect to the suggestions made by the Supreme Court in M.K. Kunhimohammed Vs P. A. Ahmedkutty (1987) 4 SCC 284.
2. The Act was amended several times to adapt to the technological up gradation emerging in road transport, passenger and freight movement and in motor vehicle management. With rapidly increasing motorisation, India is facing an increasing burden of road traffic injuries and fatalities. The emotional and social trauma caused to the family which loses its bread winner, cannot be quantified. India is signatory to the Brasilia Declaration and is committed to reduce the number of road accident fatality by fifty per cent. by the year 2020. The road transport sector also plays a major role in the economy of the country.
3. Numerous representations and recommendations in the form of grievances and suggestions from various stakeholders have been received in the Ministry, citing cases of increase in road accidents, delay in issue of driving licences, the disregard of traffic rules and regulations, etc. Therefore, in order to improve road safety and transport system, certain amendments are required to be made in the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 to address safety and efficiency issues in the transport sector.
4. In view of the above, it has become necessary to amend certain provisions of the said Act. The proposed Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Bill, 2019 seeks to address the issues relating to road safety, citizen facilitation, strengthening public transport, automation and computerisation.
5. The Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Bill, 2019, inter alia, provides for the following, namely:â€”
(a) to facilitate grant of online learning licence;
(b) to replace the existing provisions of insurance with simplified provisions in order to provide expeditious help to accident victims and their families;
(c) to increase the time limit for renewal of driving licence from one month to one year before and after the expiry date;
(d) to increase the period for renewal of transport licence from three years to five years;
(e) to enable the licensing authority to grant licence even to the differently abled persons;
(f) to enable the States to promote public transport, rural transport and last mile connectivity by relaxing any of the provisions of the Act pertaining to permits;
(g) to increase the fines and penalties for violation of provisions of the Act; and
(h) to make a provision for protection of Good Samaritans.
6. The Notes on clauses explain in detail the various provisions contained in the Bill.
7. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objectives.â€
..............................
â€œClause 51 seeks to substitute Chapter XI of the Act with a new Chapter XI. This Chapter aims to simplify the third party insurance for motor vehicles. It empowers the Central Government to
prescribe the minimum premium and the corresponding liability of the insurer for such a policy. It also provides for compensation on the basis of no-fault liability, scheme for the treatment of accident victims during the golden hour and provides for increase in the compensation to accident victims to five lakh rupees in the case of death and two and a half lakh rupees in the case of grievous hurt. It also provides a scheme for interim relief to be given to claimants.â€
31. A bare perusal of clause 2 read with clause 5 (b) and clause 51 reflects that the intention of the legislature was never to withdraw protection and reliefs as regards compensation ensured by the previous existing provisions. Rather, the Bill strives more towards ensuring expeditious help to the accident victims and their families. The emotional and social trauma caused to the family which loses its bread winner, is still one of the special considerations as set forth in the Statement above, The Bill was brought with an object to replace the existing provisions of insurance with simplified provisions in order to provide expeditious help to accident victims and their families. There is nothing in the Statement of Objects and Reasons which may, either directly or indirectly, infer withdrawal of insurerâ€™s liability to pay compensation as soon as the award is declared, even in case of occurrence of breach of policy or other existence of similar grounds of defence available to the insurer. Therefore, the purpose behind bringing amendments in the Act of 1988 was clearly to provide immediate financial help to the accident victims and their dependents and not to create a situation where they are made to run from pillar to post even after an award is declared in their favour.
PURPOSIVE INTERPRETATION OF STATUTE
32. Jurisprudence of statutory interpretation has moved from literal interpretation to purposive interpretation, which advances the purpose and object of a legislation. The Supreme Court in catena of judgments has dealt with the issue of literal interpretation vis-a-vis purposive interpretation. The Apex Court, in Central India Spinning and Weaving Manufacturing Comp. versus Municipal Committee, Wardha, AIR 1958 SC 341 has held that it is a recognized principle of construction that general words and phrases however wide and comprehensive they may be in their literal sense must usually be construed as being limited to the actual objects of the Act.
33. In Girdhari Lal & Sons versus Balbir Nath Mathur); 1986 (2) SCC 237, it was held that the primary and foremost task of a Court in interpreting a statute is to ascertain the intention of the legislature, actual or imputed. Having ascertained the intention, the Court must then strive to so interpret the statute as to promote and advance the object and purpose of the enactment. For this purpose, where necessary the Court may even depart from the rule that plain words should be interpreted according to their plain meaning. There need no meek and mute submission to the plainness of the language. To avoid patent injustice, anomaly or absurdity or to avoid invalidation of a law, the court would be well justified in departing from the so-called golden rule of construction so as to give effect to the object and purpose of the enactment by supplementing the written word if necessary. Ascertainment of legislative intent is a basic rule of statutory construction and that a rule of construction should be preferred which advances the purpose and object of a legislation and that though a construction, according to plain language, should ordinarily be adopted, such a construction should not be adopted where it leads to anomalies, injustices, or absurdities, vide K.P. Varghese v. ITO, (1981) 4 SCC 173, State Bank of Travancore v. Mohd. M. Khan, (1981) 4 SCC 82, Som Prakash Rekhi v. Union of India (1981) 1 SCC 449, Ravula Subba Rao v. CIT, AIR 1956 SC 604, Govindlal V Agricultural Produce Market Committee, (1975) 2 SCC 482 and Babaji Kondaji v. Nasik Merchants Co-op Bank Ltd. (1984) 2 SCC 50.
34. Utkal Contractors & Joinery Pvt. Ltd. versus State of Orissa; 1987 (3) SCC 279 is an authority holding that a statute is best understood if we know the reason for it. The reason for a statute is the safest guide to its interpretation. The words of a statute take their colour from the reason for it. There are external and internal aids. The external aids are Statement of Objects and Reasons when the Bill is presented to Parliament, the reports of Committees which preceded the Bill and the reports of Parliamentary Committees. Occasional excursions into the debates of Parliament are permitted. Internal aids are the Preamble, the scheme and the provisions of the Act. Having discovered the reason for the statute and so having set the sail to the wind, the interpreter may proceed ahead. No provision in the statute and no word of the statute may be construed in isolation. Every provision and every word must be looked at generally before any provision or word is attempted to be construed. The setting and the pattern are important. It is again important to remember that Parliament does not waste its breath unnecessarily. Just as Parliament is not expected to use unnecessary expressions, Parliament is also not expected to express itself unnecessarily. Even as Parliament does not use any word without meaning something, Parliament does not legislate where no legislation is called for. Parliament cannot be assumed to legislate for the sake of legislation; nor can it be assumed to make pointless legislation. [See- Eera (through Dr. Manjula Krippendorf) v. State (NCT of Delhi) and Anr 2017(15) SCC 133].
35. The Apex Court, in Reserve Bank of India Vs. Peerless General Finance and Investment Co. Ltd. & Ors. (1987) 1 SCC 424, held that Interpretation must depend on the text and the context. They are the bases of interpretation. One may well say if the text is the texture, context is what gives the colour. Neither can be ignored. Both are important. That interpretation is best which makes the textual interpretation match the contextual. A statute is best interpreted when we know why it was enacted. With this knowledge, the statute must be read, first as a whole and then section by section, clause by clause, phrase by phrase and word by word. If a statute is looked at, in the context of its enactment, with the glasses of the statute-maker, provided by such context, its scheme, the sections, clauses, phrases and words may take colour and appear different than when the statute is looked at without the glasses provided by the context. With these glasses we must look at the Act as a whole and discover what each section, each clause, each phrase and each word is meant and designed to say as to fit into the scheme of the entire Act. No part of a statute and no word of a statute can be construed in isolation. Statutes have to be construed so that every word has a place and everything is in its place.
36. Same view has been reiterated in S. Gopal Reddy Vs. State of Andhra Pradesh, (1996) 4 SCC 596, Prakash Kumar Alias Prakash Bhutto Vs. State of Gujarat, (2005) 2 SCC 409, Anwar Hasan Khan Vs. Mohd. Shafi & Ors. (2001) 8 SCC 540, Union of India & Ors. Vs. Filip Tiago De Gama of Vedem Vasco De Gama, (1990) 1 SCC 277, Reserve Bank of India v. Peerless General Finance and Investment Co. Ltd., (1987) 1 SCC 424: (AIR 1987 SC 1023) and N. K. Jain v. C. K. Shah (1991) 2 SCC 495: (AIR 1991 SC1289).
37. From the over all discussion made above, it is crystal clear that the object of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, either before the amendment or thereafter, particularly covered by Chapter XI thereof, is to compensate victims of accidents in case of an insurance policy being in existence. In view of the interpretation made, holding that omission of the proviso would exonerate the insurer of its liability to indemnify at the first instance would be too wild a proposition and would result in creating a situation where the insurer would be out of scene despite an insurance policy being there and the claimants would have to again fight for getting the amount of compensation through execution proceedings in one way or the other, searching the owner through the process of Court. In such an event, the claimants would face further harassment and nobody knows that despite a money decree in the nature of an award being there in their favour, as to whether the claimants would ever be able to get the compensation realized through recovery proceedings directly from the owner. Accordingly, the legislative intent becomes clear and there is nothing to support the insurerâ€™s arguments flowing from interpretation of Statute or Causus Omissus. The contention advanced on behalf of insurer stands discarded.
CONCLUSION
38. The Court, therefore, holds that mere omission of proviso attached to sub-section (4) of Section 149 of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 after its replacement by Section 150 of Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019 (32 of 2019), neither takes away the liability of the insurer to pay the claimants nor its right to recover the said amount from the owner. The law to this effect remains intact and unaffected by Amendment Act, 2019 and, hence, insurer shall continue to indemnify the ownerâ€™s risk in relation to accidents taking place after 01.04.2022 and â€œPAY & RECOVERâ€ principle will still continue to govern the field advancing social object of the Statute protecting third party interest. Principle of law laid down by the Supreme Court in National Insurance Company Limited vs. Swaran Singh and others, JT 2004 (1) SC 109 has not lost its significance and binding effect despite omission of proviso. Held accordingly.
39. Consequently, all the appeals fail and are dismissed.

Nachimuthu Nagar Kudiyiruppor Nala Sangam and Others
(Civil Appeal No. 5875 of 2023)
28 August 2024
[Vikram Nath and Ahsanuddin Amanullah,* JJ.]
Issue for Consideration
Whether the suit land was under any sort of legal encumbrance
so as to make it unfit for transfer of right, title and interest thereon
in light of the Layout Plan notified by the Deputy Director, Town
and Country Planning, Thanjavur region in the year 1978 and later
revised in the year 1981.
Headnotes†
Tamil Nadu Town and Country Planning Act, 1972 – ss.37 and
38 – For a creation of a Nagar various plots were formed by
one N – In a Layout plan, a portion of land was earmarked for
public purpose for welfare of the residents – That earmarked
site is the suit land/property – N died on 29.04.2004 – Appellants
case that after the death of N, the suit property was sold by
his legal heirs to appellants – The cause of action arose when
appellant no.1 started construction of a building on the suit
property – Respondents no.1 and 2/original plaintiffs are the
office-bearers of the Resident Welfare Association, who filed
suit and sought relief of permanent injunction, restraining
the defendants from encroaching upon the suit property
and putting up construction – Trial Court decreed suit – The
First Appellate Court dismissed the suit – However, the High
Court restored the judgment and decree of the Trial Court –
Correctness:
Held: In the case at hand, although the Layout (originally 1978
and revised in 1981) shows that it has been earmarked for a
public purpose – However, admittedly, nothing happened thereafter
in terms of Section 37 of the Act, namely, neither was the land
acquired under land acquisition laws nor any agreement was made
with the person(s)/owners – Neither the State Government nor
* Author
1674 [2024] 8 S.C.R.Digital Supreme Court Reports
Respondent no.3 acted to takeover or gain ownership of the suit
property – No steps were taken either by the planning authority
or the State Government to acquire the land which as per the Act
was required to be done within 3 years from publication – This
apart, ultimately in the year 2005, the Layout itself was revised
showing it as a mixed residential area – Be that as it may, on the
core issue, the original owner of the suit property, never lost right,
title, interest and usage therein – The deeming provision under
Section 38(b) of the Act would operate to release the suit property,
as the 3-year period would have lapsed, latest in 1984, counted
from the year of revision i.e., 1981, after the initial Layout in the
year 1978 – The original owner, thus, was competent in law to
transfer the suit property to any other person on 20.04.2009 (date
of the first Sale Deed) – Thus, the suit filed by the respondents
had absolutely no cause of action evincible from a reading of the
plaint – The First Appellate Court rightly interfered and dismissed
the suit – The reasoning given by the Trial Court as well as the
High Court, is erroneous, and cannot be sustained. [Paras 22, 24]

Heard learned counsel for the parties.
2. The present appeal arises from the Final Judgment and Order
dated 24.01.2022 (hereinafter referred to as the “Impugned Order”),
passed by a learned Single Judge of the High Court of Judicature at
Madras (hereinafter referred to as the “High Court”) in S.A. No.794
of 2019, whereby the appeal filed by the respondents was allowed
setting aside Judgment and Decree dated 25.04.2019 passed in A.S.
No.71 of 2017 on the file of the Principal Sub-Court, Mayiladuthurai
(hereinafter referred to as the “First Appellate Court”) and confirming
Judgment and Decree, dated 13.09.2017, passed in O.S. No.265 of
2013 (hereinafter referred to as the “suit”) on the file of the Principal
District Munsif Court, Mayiladuthurai (hereinafter referred to as the
“Trial Court”).
A FACTUAL APPRECIATION:
3. For the creation of Nachimuthu Nagar, plots were formed in T.S.
No.1000/1, & 2, 1002, 1003/1 & 2, 1004 of Thirumanjanaveethi,
Koorainadu, Mayiladuthurai Town by one Nachimuthu Mudaliar. This
was approved by the Regional Deputy Director of Town Planning,
Thanjai, Trichy and the Municipal Commissioner, Mayiladuthurai.
The layout was approved in 1978 and later revised in 1981. In the
Layout, a portion was earmarked for public purpose for the welfare
of the residents of Nachimuthu Nagar. That earmarked site is the
suit land/property admeasuring 11200 square feet.
1676 [2024] 8 S.C.R.Digital Supreme Court Reports
4. It is the case of the appellants that Nachimuthu Mudaliar died on
29.04.2004 and the suit property was sold by his legal heirs through
a Sale Deed on 20.04.2009 to the Appellants No.6-10. Thereafter,
vide an Exchange Deed dated 27.03.2013, Appellants no.4 & 5
(parents of Appellant no.1) were put in possession of a total area of
6145 square feet of the suit property. On the same day, through a
Sale Deed, the Appellants no.2 & 3 (brother and father-in-law of the
Appellant no.1, respectively) purchased the remaining 5055 square
feet in the suit property. The cause of action is said to have arisen
in October 2013, when Appellant no.1 made clear his intention of
constructing a building on the suit property.
5. Respondents no.1 and 2 are the office-bearers of Nachimuthu
Nagar Resident Welfare Association (hereinafter referred to as
the “Society”), which is registered with the District Registrar,
Mayiladuthurai. They are the original plaintiffs in the suit, which was
originally filed against Appellant No.1 (later on, Appellants no.2-10
were impleaded 1 in the suit). The suit sought the grant of “relief of
permanent injunction, restraining the defendants, their men, from
in any manner, encroaching upon the suit property and put up any
construction or disturbing in any manner.” (sic).
6. The Trial Court, after hearing the parties and perusing the evidence
on record, noted that permission should have been obtained from
the Joint Director for changing the public purpose site and to sell the
same, in the manner in which approval was obtained for Nachimuthu
Nagar layout. In the absence of such permission, the legal heirs of
Nachimuthu Mudaliar did not have a right to change the character
of the suit property. Further, it was noted that the Family Partition
Deed dated 31.07.1980, on the basis of which Sale Deed dated
20.04.2009 was created, was not produced before the court. The Trial
Court opined, hence, that the Sale Deed 20.04.2009 was not legally
proved. Consequently, the subsequent Sale Deed and Exchange
Deed (mentioned supra) made in favour of the appellants was also
held not to have been proved. On this basis, the Trial Court decreed
1 Appellant nos.2-5 were impleaded vide Order of the Trial Court dated 21.02.2014. Appellant nos.6-10
were impleaded vide Order of the Trial Court dated 17.12.2014.
[2024] 8 S.C.R. 1677Pradhan Babu and Others v.
Nachimuthu Nagar Kudiyiruppor Nala Sangam and Others
the suit and granted permanent injunction against the appellants,
as was sought.
7. Aggrieved by the decision of the Trial Court, the appellants filed
an appeal viz. A.S. No.71 of 2017 before the First Appellate Court.
On consideration of the issues that fell before it, the First Appellate
Court allowed the appeal and dismissed the suit of the respondents.
While doing so, it was noted that though the suit property was
reserved for public purpose, since it was neither in the possession
of the respondents or the Municipal Authority nor was it seized, the
character of the suit property was not maintained as such. Further,
on perusal of the documentary evidence produced before it, the First
Appellate Court took the view that transfer of title had taken place
in favour of the appellants and the suit was bad for non-joinder of
necessary parties and in the absence of a prayer for declaration.
8. Against the decision rendered by the First Appellate Court, the
respondents preferred a second appeal, namely S.A. No.794 of 2019
before the High Court, which was allowed vide the Impugned Order
and the Judgment and Decree of the Trial Court dated 13.09.2017
was restored.
SUBMISSIONS BY THE APPELLANTS:
9. At the outset, learned senior counsel for the Appellants submitted
that the High Court fell in error in reversing the well-reasoned order
of the First Appellate Court and holding that, in the absence of
permission under Section 38 of the Tamil Nadu Town and Country
Planning Act, 1972 (hereinafter referred to as the “Act”), the Sale
Deed made by the legal heirs of Nachimuthu Mudaliar would be illegal,
without correct appreciation of the provision in its true sense. It was
contended that under the said provision, if the land which is reserved
for Public Purpose is not utilized/acquired by the Government within
3 years of the reservation, the same stands released automatically
from reservation.
10. It was submitted that the suit property in the present case was
reserved for ‘public purpose’ in the year 1978 in the Layout,
which reservation was continued in the year 1981. However, since
thereafter, no steps were taken by the Municipality for putting up the
1678 [2024] 8 S.C.R.Digital Supreme Court Reports
suit property for public purpose and in fact, the said land was lying
as vacant land, for which the owners were paying tax also. It was
urged that as such, by virtue of Section 38(b) of the Act, the suit
property is deemed to be released from the Development Plan of the
Municipal Council and there is no question for the owners to obtain
any permission before selling the suit property. It was submitted that
the above provision came into force even before the notifying of the
Master Development Plan for Mayiladuthurai Municipality; later the
modified Master Development Plan for Mayiladuthurai Municipality,
which was notified by the State Government in GO(Ms) No.100
issued by the Housing and Urban Development Department dated
21.03.2005.
11. It was argued that in the present case, the suit property has not
acquired the character of public property so as to be owned by
all the public of Nachimuthu Nagar but the same was reserved for
“Public Purpose” in the Layout Plan by the Municipality. As such
the ownership of the property always remained with the family of
Nachimuthu Mudaliar and they always had the right to sell the same,
after the suit property was deemed to be released under Section
38(b) of the Act. It was contended that seeking permission is a
mere administrative act and seeking such permission is not made
mandatory by the Act.
12. Next, it was submitted that Section 38 of the Act is a directory
provision and not obtaining previous permission of the Municipal
Authorities would not render the Sale Deeds in question invalid. Since,
no consequence is provided in Section 38 or any other provision in
the Act to treat the transaction in violation of Section 38 as void, the
transfer in favour of Appellants no.2 to 10 cannot be regarded as
ineffective or invalid. Such a transfer would at best be voidable, that
too only at the instance of the Municipality concerned and none else.
13. It was submitted that respondents have no right or interest in the
suit property as the same is still a private property in the hand of
the original owners, even though reserved for Public Purpose at one
point of time. And admittedly, till date the suit property was/is not
utilised for Public Purpose (even after a lapse of more than 30 years)
by the Municipality concerned. Therefore, reservation in respect of
the same stood lapsed long back in terms of Section 38 of the Act.
[2024] 8 S.C.R. 1679Pradhan Babu and Others v.
Nachimuthu Nagar Kudiyiruppor Nala Sangam and Others
It was pointed out that undisputed possession and enjoyment of the
suit property, based on registered documents, for over three and
a half decades had remained with the appellant(s) concerned and
their predecessors-in-title, and they had acquired rights thereupon
by way of adverse possession. Thus, the claim made by a newly-
formed Society [Respondents no.1 and 2] after 35 years is barred
by limitation.
14. It was further submitted that the suit filed by the original plaintiffs/
respondents without seeking the relief of declaration as to title is
not maintainable in view of the fact that the suit property is not a
public property, but a private property reserved for public purpose
whose character has changed over the years. The further contention
was that the suit filed by the original plaintiffs/respondents is not
with bonafide intention which is evident from the fact that the
sangam-society was formed just prior to the filing of the suit and that
too without following the requisite procedure. For all these reasons,
the learned senior counsel prayed for allowing the appeal and sought
setting aside of the Impugned Order.
SUBMISSIONS BY RESPONDENTS NO.1 AND 2/SOCIETY:
15. Learned counsel for the Society began by submitting that there is no
question of law, much less, a substantial question of law involved in
the present case under Article 1362 of the Constitution of India and
therefore the appeal is liable to be dismissed in limine. He submitted
that the Trial Court has given a just, fair and cogent judgment based
on reliable evidence, which has been affirmed by the High Court,
and as such, does not require interference by this Court.
16. It was submitted that the Act provides for planning the development
and use of rural and urban land in the State of Tamil Nadu and for
purposes connected therewith. The suit property was part of the
Housing Layout and it was earmarked for public purpose when the
Layout was formed in 1978 or when it was revised in 1981. The
2 ‘136. Special leave to appeal by the Supreme Court.—(1) Notwithstanding anything in this Chapter,
the Supreme Court may, in its discretion, grant special leave to appeal from any judgment, decree,
determination, sentence or order in any cause or matter passed or made by any court or tribunal in the
territory of India.
(2) Nothing in clause (1) shall apply to any judgment, determination, sentence or order passed or made
by any court or tribunal constituted by or under any law relating to the Armed Forces.’
1680 [2024] 8 S.C.R.Digital Supreme Court Reports
land was not acquired as required under the Act and Section 38
of the Act is not applicable to the suit property, submitted learned
counsel.
17. It was canvassed that once, as per the Layout Plan, the area is
notified as being for public purpose while forming the Layout, the
same cannot be converted into personal property. It was contended
that the suit property is not acquired by the Government under the Act
and therefore the provisions in the Act cannot be invoked in respect
of Nachimuthu Nagar. The Act will apply in a case where acquisition
is made, and property is kept vacant without construction. Therefore,
the Trial Court and High Court correctly appreciated the distinction
and decreed the suit as prayed for. Learned counsel prayed for the
dismissal of the appeal.
RE RESPONDENT NO.3/THE MUNICIPALITY:
18. Respondent no.3 was impleaded under our Order dated 16.05.2024
for a limited purpose. In view of the discussion infra, nothing more
needs to be noted.
ANALYSIS, REASONING AND CONCLUSION:
19. Having given our anxious thought to the lis, after perusing the
materials and in view of the submissions advanced, we find that
the moot question involved is whether the suit land was under any
sort of legal encumbrance so as to make it unfit for transfer of right,
title and interest thereon in light of the Layout Plan notified by the
Deputy Director, Town and Country Planning, Thanjavur region in
the year 1978 and later revised in the year 1981.
20. On this, the admitted fact is that at the time when the Layout Plan
was originally notified in the year 1978, the suit property reflected
as being in private hands as per the record of the land registry, not
belonging to the State Government nor to the Municipality/Respondent
no.3. At the relevant time i.e., in 1978, only the intention of the
competent authority under the relevant statute was discernible that
it had formed an opinion with regard to the suit land/property being
required to be kept reserved for ‘public purpose’. It would be useful
to extract Chapter IV of the Act containing Sections 36 to 39 titled
‘Acquisition and Disposal of Land’:
[2024] 8 S.C.R. 1681Pradhan Babu and Others v.
Nachimuthu Nagar Kudiyiruppor Nala Sangam and Others
‘36. Power to acquire land under the Land Acquisition
Act.—Any land required, reserved or designated in a
regional plan, master plan, detailed development plan or
a new town development plan, as the case may be, shall
be deemed to be land needed for a public purpose within
the meaning of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (Act 1 of
1894) and may be acquired under the said Act as modified
in the manner provided in this Act.
37. Power to purchase or acquire lands specified
in development plan.—(1) Where after the publication
of the notice in the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette of
preparation of a regional plan, master plan, detailed
development plan or a new town development plan,
as the case may be, any land is required, reserved or
designated in such plan the appropriate planning authority
may, either enter into agreement with any person for the
acquisition from him by purchase of any land which may
be acquired under Section 36 or make an application to
the Government for acquiring such land under the Land
Acquisition Act, 1894 (Act 1 of 1894):
Provided that if the value of such land exceeds fifty
thousand rupees, the appropriate planning authority shall
not enter into such agreement without the previous approval
of the Government.
(2) On receipt of an application made under sub-section
(1), if the Government are satisfied that the land specified
in the application is needed for the public purpose specified
therein, they may make a declaration to that effect in
the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette, in the manner
provided in Section 6 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894
(Act 1 of 1894), in respect of the said land. The declaration
so published shall notwithstanding anything contained in
the said Act, be deemed to be a declaration duly made
under the said Section 6 of the said Act:
Provided that no such declaration in respect of any
particular land covered by a notice under Section 26 or
1682 [2024] 8 S.C.R.Digital Supreme Court Reports
Section 27 shall be made after the expiry of three years
from the date of such notice.
(3) On the publication of such declaration, the Collector
of the district within whose jurisdiction the land is situate
shall proceed to take order for the acquisition of such
land under the said Act; and the provisions of that Act
shall, so far as may be apply to the acquisition, of the
said land, with the modification that the market value
of the land shall be the market value prevailing on the
date of the publication of the notice in the Tamil Nadu
Government Gazette under Section 26 or Section 27, as
the case may be.
38. Release of land.—If within three years from the date of
the publication of the notice in the Tamil Nadu Government
Gazette under Section 26 or Section 27—
(a) no declaration as provided in sub-section (2) of Section
37 is published in respect of any land reserved, allotted
or designated for any purpose specified in a regional
plan, master plan, detailed development plan or new town
development plan covered by such notice; or
(b) such land is not acquired by agreement such land
shall be deemed to be released from such reservation,
allotment or designation.
39. Right to compensation.—(1) Any person whose
property is injuriously affected by virtue of any of the
provisions contained in any regional plan, master plan,
detailed development plan or a new town development plan
made under this Act shall, if he prefers a claim for the purpose
to the Tribunal with such particulars and within such period
as may be prescribed, be entitled to obtain compensation
in respect thereof as determined by the Tribunal:
Provided that property shall not be deemed to be injuriously
affected by reason of any of the provisions inserted in any
development plan which impose any condition or restriction
in regard to any of the matters specified in clause (f) of
sub-section (2) of Section 15, or in clauses (k) and (f) of
[2024] 8 S.C.R. 1683Pradhan Babu and Others v.
Nachimuthu Nagar Kudiyiruppor Nala Sangam and Others
sub-section (2) of Section 17 or in clauses (m) and (n) of
sub-section (1) of Section 20, as the case may be.
(2) If at any time after the day on which any regional
plan master plan, detailed development plan or a new
town development plan has come into force, such plan
is varied, or revoked, any person who has incurred any
expenditure for the purpose of complying with such plan,
shall, if he prefers a claim for the purpose to the Tribunal
with such particulars and within such time as may be
prescribed, be entitled to obtain compensation in respect
thereof as determined by the Tribunal, if by reason only of
the variation or revocation of such plan, such expenditure
has ceased to be in any way beneficial to him.’
21. A perusal of Chapter IV of the Act brings to the fore the scheme
thereunder. For the present, we are unbothered by Section 39 of the
Act. Section 36 of the Act states that any land required, reserved or
designated in a regional plan, master plan, detailed development plan
or a new town development plan shall be deemed to be land needed
for a ‘public purpose’ and can be acquired under the land acquisition
laws as modified under the Act. Section 37(1) of the Act permits the
appropriate planning authority to enter into an agreement with a
person to acquire such land by way of purchase, or to apply to the
Government for acquisition of such land under the land acquisition
laws in force. Section 38 of the Act mandates that if, within three
years from the date of publication in the Tamil Nadu Government
Gazette under Sections 26 or 27 of the Act, (a) no declaration under
Section 37(2) is published, or (b) the land in question is not acquired
by agreement, such land would be deemed released from reservation/
allotment/designation. At this juncture, we may also examine the
meaning and scope of the term ‘public purpose’ employed in the
Act. The relevant definitional clause reads as under:
‘2. Definitions.—In this Act, unless the context otherwise
requires,—
…
(36) “public purpose” means any purpose which is useful
to the public or any class or section of the public;’
1684 [2024] 8 S.C.R.Digital Supreme Court Reports
22. The position under the Act is that law permits a planning authority to
come out with a Layout Plan or a Master Plan for an area in which
certain area may be reserved for public purposes. Given how our
cities are fast expanding, the salutary purpose and objective behind
Section 36 of the Act is obvious. Read with Section 2(36), ‘public
purpose’ has been given a very wide connotation and could even
include keeping the identified land as open spaces to act as lungs
for the city in view of environmental considerations. However, the
caveat is that though the planning authority can include private land,
the way ahead to acquire the land, either by way of resort to land
acquisition laws as modified by the Act or by way of agreement with
the person(s) concerned [Section 37], but in accordance with the
procedure as laid out in Chapter IV of the Act. In the case at hand,
although the Layout (originally 1978 and revised in 1981) shows that
it has been earmarked for a public purpose. However, admittedly,
nothing happened thereafter in terms of Section 37 of the Act,
namely, neither was the land acquired under land acquisition laws
nor any agreement was made with the person(s)/owners. Neither the
State Government nor Respondent no.3 acted to takeover or gain
ownership of the suit property. Clearly, no steps were taken either
by the planning authority or the State Government to acquire the
land which as per the Act was required to be done within 3 years
from publication. This apart, ultimately in the year 2005, the Layout
itself was revised showing it as a mixed residential area. Be that
as it may, on the core issue, we find that the original owner of the
suit property, never lost right, title, interest and usage therein. The
deeming provision under Section 38(b) of the Act would operate to
release the suit property, as the 3-year period would have lapsed,
latest in 1984, counted from the year of revision i.e., 1981, after the
initial Layout in the year 1978. This Court in Pillayar P K V K N
Trust v Karpaga N N U S, (2010) 9 SCC 344, in the facts of that
case, concluded ‘that the land is not acquired by agreement till the
date of the judgment of the High Court, the deeming clause would
certainly come into force and, therefore, the land concerned would
certainly be deemed to have been released.’ The original owner,
thus, was competent in law to transfer the suit property to any other
person on 20.04.2009 (date of the first Sale Deed). Obviously, nemo
[2024] 8 S.C.R. 1685Pradhan Babu and Others v.
Nachimuthu Nagar Kudiyiruppor Nala Sangam and Others
dat quad non habet3 and any transfer of property would carry with it
inherently the same restrictions which were existing/passed on to the
vendor at the time of passing of the title to the concerned vendee.
23. It is not, and has not ever been, the case of the private respondents
that the appellants, who had originally bought the suit land and later
transferred it have violated the conditions of the Layouts of the
years 1978 and 1981 by constructing over it or using it other than
for a ‘public purpose’. The only cause of action on which the suit
was filed by the private respondents was that the appellants had
started construction of the boundary wall. This has been explained
by the appellants, who have stated that it was for demarcation of
the land in question and no further construction has been made on
the suit property. Moving further, even if it is accepted for the sake
of argument that some of the appellants, who were now claiming
ownership in their favour by way of Registered Sale Deed(s) in the
suit property, had made any construction and had started using the
land, there could, perhaps, be a cause of action for the respondents
to move before the appropriate forum for preventing such appellants
from either continuing with the construction or using it for a purpose
other than ‘public purpose’. The same would then have been required
to be decided by the appropriate forum after considering what was
the Layout/Master Plan applicable to the area on the date of such
consideration and whether the proposed construction or usage was
in conformity with the Plan operative on such date. However, as we
are informed, by way of the 2005 Layout, the suit property lies in a
mixed residential area.
24. Thus, for and upon a totality of reasons aforesaid, we find that the
suit filed by the respondents had absolutely no cause of action
evincible from a reading of the plaint. We hold that rightly the First
Appellate Court interfered and dismissed the suit. The reasoning
given by the Trial Court as well as the High Court, is erroneous,
and cannot be sustained. Accordingly, the order of the Trial Court as
well as the Impugned Order passed by the High Court are set aside.
The Judgment and Decree of the First Appellate Court is restored.
