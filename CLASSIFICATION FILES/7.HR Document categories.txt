A Summary of Your Rights Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act
The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) promotes the accuracy, fairness, and privacy of
information in the files of consumer reporting agencies. There are many types of consumer reporting
agencies, including credit bureaus and specialty agencies (such as agencies that sell information about
check writing histories, medical records, and rental history records). Here is a summary of your major
rights under the FCRA. For more information, including information about additional rights, go to or
write to: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 1700 G Street N.W., Washington, DC 20552.
• You must be told if information in your file has been used against you. Anyone who uses a credit
report or another type of consumer report to deny your application for credit, insurance, or
employment – or to take another adverse action against you – must tell you, and must give you the
name, address, and phone number of the agency that provided the information.
• You have the right to know what is in your file. You may request and obtain all the information
about you in the files of a consumer reporting agency (your “file disclosure”). You will be required
to provide proper identification, which may include your Social Security number. In many cases, the
disclosure will be free. You are entitled to a free file disclosure if:
o a person has taken adverse action against you because of information in your credit report;
o you are the victim of identity theft and place a fraud alert in your file;
o your file contains inaccurate information as a result of fraud;
o you are on public assistance;
o you are unemployed but expect to apply for employment within 60 days.
In addition, all consumers are entitled to one free disclosure every 12 months upon request from
each nationwide credit bureau and from nationwide specialty consumer reporting agencies. See for
additional information.
• You have the right to ask for a credit score. Credit scores are numerical summaries of your credit-
worthiness based on information from credit bureaus. You may request a credit score from
consumer reporting agencies that create scores or distribute scores used in residential real
property loans, but you will have to pay for it. In some mortgage transactions, you will receive
credit score information for free from the mortgage lender.
• You have the right to dispute incomplete or inaccurate information. If you identify information in
your file that is incomplete or inaccurate, and report it to the consumer reporting agency, the
agency must investigate unless your dispute is frivolous. See for an explanation of dispute
procedures.
• Consumer reporting agencies must correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable
information. Inaccurate, incomplete or unverifiable information must be removed or corrected,
6
Rev 04/2019
usually within 30 days. However, a consumer reporting agency may continue to report information
it has verified as accurate.
• Consumer reporting agencies may not report outdated negative information. In most cases, a
consumer reporting agency may not report negative information that is more than seven years old,
or bankruptcies that are more than 10 years old.
• Access to your file is limited. A consumer reporting agency may provide information about you
only to people with a valid need -- usually to consider an application with a creditor, insurer,
employer, landlord, or other business. The FCRA specifies those with a valid need for access.
• You must give your consent for reports to be provided to employers. A consumer reporting
agency may not give out information about you to your employer, or a potential employer, without
your written consent given to the employer. Written consent generally is not required in the
trucking industry. For more information, go to
• You may limit “prescreened” offers of credit and insurance you get based on information in your
credit report. Unsolicited “prescreened” offers for credit and insurance must include a toll-free
phone number you can call if you choose to remove your name and address from the lists these
offers are based on. You may opt out with the nationwide credit bureaus at 1-888-5-OPTOUT (1-
888-567-8688).
• You may seek damages from violators. If a consumer reporting agency, or, in some cases, a user
of consumer reports or a furnisher of information to a consumer reporting agency violates the
FCRA, you may be able to sue in state or federal court.
• Identity theft victims and active duty military personnel have additional rights. For more
information, visit http://www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore.
States may enforce the FCRA, and many states have their own consumer reporting laws. In some
cases, you may have more rights under state law. For more information, contact your state or local
consumer protection agency or your state Attorney General. For information about your federal
rights, contact:

Consumers have the right to obtain a security freeze:
You have a right to place a ''security freeze'' on your credit report, which will prohibit a
consumer reporting agency from releasing information in your credit report without your express
authorization. The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being
approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a security
freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit
report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or
application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the
extension of credit. As an alternative to a security freeze, you have the right to place an initial or
extended fraud alert on your credit file at no cost. An initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed
on a consumer's credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is
required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim
of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting 7 years. A
security freeze does not apply to a person or entity, or its affiliates, or collection agencies acting on
behalf of the person or entity, with which you have an existing account that requests information in
your credit report for the purposes of reviewing or collecting the account. Reviewing the account
includes activities related to account maintenance, monitoring, credit line increases, and account
upgrades and enhancements.

you contact the right local state agency.
In the U.S., we have appointed the AMR People & Culture Director as our EEO
officer. It is his/her responsibility to monitor Logitech’s affirmative action program and to
ensure our commitment to equal employment opportunities including Logitech’s policy

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT
This Employment Agreement (the “Agreement”) is effective as of January 6, 2004
(the “Effective Date”) by and between John O’Keefe (the “Executive”) and Verdisys, Inc., a
California corporation (the “Company”).
1. Duties and Scope of Employment.
(a) Position. For the term of this Agreement, the Company agrees to employ
the Executive in the position of Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (the
“Employment”). The duties and responsibilities of Executive shall include the duties and
responsibilities for the Executive’s corporate office and position as set forth in the
Company’s bylaws and such other duties and responsibilities as the Company’s Chief
Executive Officer and/or Board of Directors may from time to time reasonably assign to
the Executive.
(b) Obligations to the Company. During his Employment, the Executive
shall devote his full business efforts and time to the Company. During his Employment,
without prior written approval from the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, the
Executive shall not render services in any capacity to any other person or entity and shall
not act as a sole proprietor or partner of any other person or entity or as a shareholder or
other owner owning more than ten percent of the stock or other interests of any other
corporation or entity. This obligation, however, shall not preclude Executive from
engaging in appropriate civic, charitable or religious activities or from devoting a
reasonable amount of time to private investments or from serving on the boards of
directors of companies, including closely held companies which are controlled by
Executive as long as these activities or services do not materially interfere or conflict
with Executive’s responsibilities to, or ability to perform his duties of employment by,
the Company under this Agreement. The Executive shall comply with the Company’s
policies and rules as they may be in effect from time to time during his Employment.
(c) No Conflicting Obligations. The Executive represents and warrants to
the Company that he is under no obligations or commitments, whether contractual or
otherwise, that are inconsistent with his obligations under this Agreement. The Executive
represents and warrants that he will not use or disclose, in connection with his
employment by the Company, any trade secrets or other proprietary information or
intellectual property in which the Executive or any other person has any right, title or
interest and that his employment by the Company as contemplated by this Agreement
will not infringe or violate the rights of any other person. The Executive represents and
warrants to the Company that he has returned all property and confidential information
belonging to any prior employer.
2. Cash and Incentive Compensation.
(a) Salary. The Company shall pay the Executive as compensation for his
services during the first twelve (12) months of his Employment a base salary at a gross
annual rate of $175,000. Such salary shall be payable in accordance with the Company’s
standard payroll procedures. Only in the event that the parties extend the term of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 4(a), then Company shall pay the Executive as
compensation for his service during the second twelve (12) months of his Employment a
base salary at a gross annual rate of $195,000 and, if applicable, for his service during the
third twelve (12) months of his Employment a base salary at a gross annual rate of
$215,000. (The annual compensation specified in this Subsection (a), together with any
increases in such compensation as a result of an extension of the term of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 4(a), is referred to in this Agreement as “Base Compensation.”)
(b) Bonus. Executive shall receive a one time payment of $40,000 as a sign
on bonus and shall be included in the Company Executive Compensation program,
whereby senior management are eligible to receive annual bonuses of up to 50% of their
base compensation.
(c) Options. Executive shall be eligible to be considered for stock option
grants under the Company’s annual stock option award program as administered by, and
at the discretion of, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. An initial
option shall be granted to the Executive for the right to purchase an aggregate of 80,000
shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price based upon the date of
approval by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Such option shall
vest quarterly over the initial term of this Agreement.
(d) Insurance Coverage Reimbursement. Company agrees to pay Executive
at current rate of $394 per month to cover and to be in lieu of medical benefits, as
selected by Executive in his sole discretion. Executive understands and agrees that
Company is not required to permit Executive to participate in any Company-sponsored
benefit plans, including but not limited to the Company’s medical plan, in the same or
any manner as Company and any third-party benefit provider make such opportunities
available to Company’s regular full-time employees; provided, however, if Company
does provide such Company-sponsored benefit plans and Executive is eligible to
participate in such Company-sponsored benefit plans, Executive shall not be entitled to
receive such $394 monthly payment.
(e) Vacation. During the term of this Agreement, Executive shall be entitled
to vacation each year in accordance with the Company’s policies in effect from time to
time, but in no event less than four (4) weeks paid vacation per calendar year.
3. Business Expenses. During his Employment, the Executive shall be
authorized to incur necessary and reasonable travel, entertainment and other business
expenses in connection with his duties hereunder. The Company shall reimburse the
Executive for such expenses upon presentation of an itemized account and appropriate
supporting documentation, all in accordance with the Company’s generally applicable
2
policies. The Executive shall have a car allowance of $1,000.00 per month during the
term of this Agreement.
4. Term of Employment.
(a) Term. This Agreement shall expire on the first anniversary of the
Effective Date, unless otherwise extended by the mutual agreement of Executive and the
Company; provided, that this Agreement shall automatically be renewed for additional
one (1) year terms and shall automatically be continued effective as of the subsequent
anniversary date of the Agreement (a “Renewal Date”) unless the Company or Executive
has delivered written notice of non-renewal to the other party at least sixty (60) days prior
to the relevant Renewal Date.
(b) Basic Rule. The Executive’s Employment with the Company shall be “at
will,” meaning that either the Executive or the Company shall be entitled to terminate the
Executive’s Employment at any time and for any reason, with or without Cause (in the
case of the Company) or Constructive Termination (in the case of Executive). Any
contrary representations that may have been made to the Executive shall be superseded
by this Agreement. This Agreement shall constitute the full and complete agreement
between the Executive and the Company on the “at will” nature of the Executive’s
Employment, which may be changed only in an express written agreement signed by the
Executive and a duly authorized officer of the Company.
(c) Termination. The Company or the Executive may terminate the
Executive’s Employment at any time and for any reason (or no reason), and with or
without Cause (in the case of the Company) or Constructive Termination (in the case of
Executive), by giving the other party notice in writing. The Executive’s Employment
shall terminate automatically in the event of his death.
(d) Rights Upon Termination. Except as expressly provided in Section 5,
upon the termination of the Executive’s Employment pursuant to this Section 4, the
Executive shall be entitled only to the compensation, benefits and reimbursements
described in Sections 2 and 3 for the period preceding the effective date of the
termination.
5. Termination Benefits.
(a) General Release. Any other provision of this Agreement
notwithstanding, Subsections (b), (c), and (d) below shall not apply unless the Employee
(i) has executed a general release (in a form reasonably prescribed by the Company) of
all known and unknown claims that he may then have against the Company or persons
affiliated with the Company, and (ii) has agreed not to prosecute any legal action or other
proceeding based upon any of such claims.
(b) Severance Pay. If, during the term of this Agreement, the Company
terminates the Executive’s Employment for any reason other than Cause or Disability, or
if the Executive voluntarily resigns following a Constructive Termination, (collectively, a
“Termination Event”), then the Company shall pay the Executive his Base Compensation
3
for the remaining period of the then-current term of this Agreement, but not in excess of
six (6) months. Such Base Compensation shall be paid as a lump sum within thirty (30)
days after the Termination Event. In addition, the Company shall also reimburse the
Executive for the payment of the Executive’s COBRA or equivalent other replacement
medical and dental insurance premiums for a period of six (6) months.
(c) Stock Options. With respect to all stock options in the Company granted
to Executive prior to the effective date of the Termination Event, an amount of option
shares equal to the number of months for which Executive is entitled to receive severance
pay will become immediately vested, not subject to repurchase and not subject to
assumption, assignment or replacement by the Company or its successors.
(d) Disability. If the Executive’s employment is terminated by the Company
by reason of the Executive’s Disability, the Executive shall be entitled to a prompt cash
payment of a prorated portion of the payments set forth in Section 2(a) above for the year
in which such termination occurs. Executive and his eligible dependents shall be entitled
to continued participation so long as he is disabled and is not eligible for coverage under
a successor employer’s plans through the month in which the Executive attains age sixty-
five (65) in all medical, dental, vision and hospitalization insurance coverage, and in all
other employee welfare benefit plans, programs and arrangements in which he was
participating on the date of termination of his employment for Disability on terms and
conditions that are no less favorable than those applicable, from time to time, to senior
executives of the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, “Disability” means the
Executive’s inability, due to physical or mental incapacity, to substantially perform his
duties and responsibilities contemplated by this Agreement. In the event of a dispute as to
whether the Executive is disabled, the determination shall be made by a licensed medical
doctor selected by the Company and agreed to by the Executive. If the parties cannot
agree on a medical doctor, each party shall select a medical doctor and the two doctors
shall select a third who shall be the approved medical doctor for this purpose. The
Executive agrees to submit to such tests and examinations as such medical doctor shall
deem appropriate.
(e) Definition of “Cause.” For all purposes under this Agreement, “Cause”
shall mean:

Competition Agreement referenced in Section 6 hereof between the Executive
and the Company, as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company;
(ii) Conviction of, or a plea of “guilty” or “no contest” to, a felony, or
a plea of “guilty” or “no contest” to a lesser included offense in exchange for

(iii) Any act or acts of fraud;
(iv) violations of applicable laws, rules or regulations that expose the
4
Company to material damages or material liability
(v) material breach by the employee of any material provision of the
Employment Agreement that remains uncorrected for 30 days following written
notice of such breach to the employee by the company.
(f) Definition of “Constructive Termination.” For all purposes under this
Agreement, Constructive Termination shall mean the voluntary resignation of the
Executive within 60 days following:
(i) The failure of the Executive to be elected or reelected to any of
the positions described in Section 1(a) or his removal from any such position
without his written consent.
(ii) A material diminution in the Executive’s duties or the assignment
of him of any duties inconsistent with the Executive’s position and status as

counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall
constitute one and the same instrument.

Collective Bargaining Agreement (Sample)
Implementing district-wide use of video for teacher evaluation or professional development will require
working with the local teachers unions and, in rare cases, involve collective bargaining. Before starting
those conversations it is important to be fully aware of the collective bargaining practices in your state
or district. As you know, gaining the support of the teachers unions is critical to the success of video
observations.
On the next page, we have provided an example of how one district has addressed the use of video in
teacher evaluations in their collective bargaining agreement. This is by no means the only way to
address the use of video but hopefully the language provides a starting point to draw from in your own
context.
CONTRACT AGREEMENT 20149
7. The parties agree to create an evaluator form that will allow
evaluators to rate and delineate between all components
observed during a classroom observation as well as (for
components 1a, 1e, and 4e only) observed within fifteen
(15) school days prior to the classroom observation as part
of an assessment of a teacher’s preparation and profes-
sionalism. Each evaluator form shall contain lesson-spe-
cific evidence for components observed during a classroom
observation and teacher-specific evidence for components
observed as part of an assessment of a teacher’s prepara-
tion and professionalism.
8. An evaluator shall not include or consider evidence regard-
ing the preparation and professionalism on an evaluator
form if such evidence (or conduct) is also contained in a
disciplinary letter to the teacher’s file, unless the evidence
was directly observed by the evaluator during a classroom
observation (in which case the evidence may be on both
an evaluator form and in a disciplinary letter). Evidence
not related to components 1a, 1e, and/or 4e, or directly
observed by the evaluator in the fifteen (15) school day
period immediately preceding a classroom observation
shall not be considered in a teacher’s evaluation.
9. Consistent with the Commissioner’s Decision, there shall
be Initial Planning Conferences (“IPC”) and Summative
End of Year Conferences (as defined therein). Teachers
shall have the sole discretion of setting professional goals
as part of the IPC. The DOE will explicitly state this in guid-
ance for evaluators and educators for the 2014-15 school
year and thereafter.
Videotaping and Photographing
1. All observations shall be conducted in person. The teacher
and evaluator may mutually consent to evaluators not being
present when videotaping.
2. A teacher may choose to have his/her observations video-
taped. If a teacher chooses to have his/her observations
videotaped he/she shall select among the following options:
(a) the evaluator will choose what observations, if any,
will be videotaped; or (b) the evaluator shall videotape
the observations in the following manner: (i) if the
teacher selected Option 1, the formal observation shall
be videotaped; (ii) if the teacher selected Option 2, two
(2) of the informal observations shall be videotaped (at
the evaluator’s option); or (iii) if the teacher selected
Option 3, one (1) of the informal observations shall be
videotaped (at the evaluator’s option).
3. Evaluators who take photographs during observations rel-
evant to the Danielson Rubric, should, to the extent prac-
ticable, be unobtrusive (for example, photographs may be
taken at the end of the observation).
Covered Employees
1. The DOE and the UFT agree to jointly request that the
State Education Department issue a determination as to
whether teachers of programs for suspended students and
teachers of programs of incarcerated students are subject
to Education Law § 3012-c (and therefore subject to this
APPR Plan). Such decision shall be incorporated by refer-
ence into this APPR Plan.
2. In order for a classroom teacher to be covered by this
APPR Plan, the teacher must be teaching for at least six
(6) cumulative calendar months in a school year. If the
teacher does not satisfy this requirement he/she shall not
be covered by this APPR Plan and shall be subject to the
evaluation system set forth in Article 8J of the collective
bargaining agreement and Teaching for the 21st Century.
3. The following shall apply to teachers who are teaching for
more than six (6) cumulative calendar months in a school
year but less than the full year due to either (a) paid or
unpaid leave of absence; (b) reassignment from teaching
responsibilities; or (c) the teacher commenced, or sepa-
rated from, employment mid-year:
(a) When a teacher is absent from the first day of school
until the last Friday of October, the IPC (as defined in
this APPR Plan) shall be conducted within ten (10)
school days of his/her return to school.
(b) When a teacher is absent between the last Friday of
April and the last Friday of June, and the absence
was foreseen and the evaluator was aware that the
teacher would not be present during this period (e.g.,
they are taking a maternity leave), the Summative
Conference shall be held before the teacher leaves.
(c) When a teacher is absent between the last Friday of
April and the last Friday of June and the absence
was unforeseen (e.g., extended leave) and therefore
the evaluator could not conduct the Summative Con-
ference ahead of time, the Summative Conference
shall be held no later than the last Friday of October
in the following school year. Evaluators shall have
the discretion to conduct the IPC and Summative
Conference at the same time but must fulfill all the
requirements of both conferences.
(d) When a teacher is unexpectedly absent for the
remainder of the school year (e.g., extended leave),
the teacher shall have a minimum of two (2) observa-
tions, which shall fulfill the observation requirements
set forth herein.
(e) When a teacher is absent during the period when the
baseline or post-test assessments are administered,
and the teacher was assigned individual target pop-
ulations for his/her State and/or Local Measures, the
teacher will still receive Local and/or State Measures
for individual target populations.SAMPLE

Welcome
Hello and welcome! Thank you for joining [Company name], where we strive to [state
mission statement or values.] We can’t wait to see what you will achieve with us.
This employee handbook defines who we are and how we work together. we will do
everything possible to create a fair and productive workplace, but we need your help.
We’ve created this handbook to guide you.
This handbook isn’t a contract or a guarantee of employment. It’s a collection of our
expectations, commitments and responsibilities. Please read this employee handbook
carefully and consult it whenever you need to.
Getting to know our company
[Provide a brief history of your company here. If possible, use illustrations and charts to
make this information memorable. Present your company’s culture and vision. Avoid
jargon and overused phrases (e.g. “competitive,” “fast-paced environment,” “core
values” and “innovative.”) Also, it’d be a good idea to include quotes and pictures of
your company’s founders, CEO or other executives to make this introduction more
personable.]
Employment basics
In this section, we explain our employee contract types and define our basic
employment policies.
Employment contract types
Full-time employees work at least [30 hours] per week or [130 hours] per month on
average.
Part-time employees are those who work fewer than [30 hours] per week.
Full-time and part-time employees can have either temporary or indefinite duration
contracts. Full-time employees under an indefinite duration contract are entitled to our
company’s full benefits package.
[Insert this if employees are in the U.S: We remind you that, in the U.S., employment is
“at-will.” This means that you or our company may terminate our employment
relationship at any time and for any non-discriminatory reason(s).]
Equal opportunity employment
[Company’s name] is an equal opportunity employer. We don’t tolerate discrimination
against protected characteristics (gender, age, sexual orientation, race, nationality,
ethnicity, religion, disability, veteran status.) We want all employees (including
executives and HR) to treat others with respect and professionalism. In practice, this
means that we:
■ [Hire and promote people based on skills, experience or potential and try to
reduce bias in every process (e.g. through structured interviews.)]
■ [Make accommodations to help people with disabilities move about safely on our
premises and use our products, services and equipment.]
■ [Use inclusive, diversity-sensitive language in all official documents, signs and job
ads.]
■ [Conduct diversity and communication training.]
Apart from those actions, we commit to penalizing every discriminatory, offensive or
inappropriate behavior. To do this properly, we ask you to report any discriminatory
action against yourself or your colleagues to HR. Our company will not retaliate against
you if you file a complaint or discrimination lawsuit. Any employee who retaliates or
discriminates will face disciplinary action.
Recruitment and selection process
Our hiring steps might vary across roles, but we always aim for a process that is fair and
effective in hiring great people. If you are hiring for an open role, you will likely go
through these steps:
i. Identify the need for a new job opening.
ii. Decide whether to hire externally or internally.
iii. Review job descriptions and write a job ad.
iv. Get approval for your job ad.
v. Select appropriate sources (external or internal) to post your job opening.
vi. Decide on hiring stages and possible timeframes.
vii. Review resumes in our company database/ATS.
viii. Source passive candidates.
ix. Shortlist applicants.
x. Screen and interview candidates.
xi. Run background checks and check references.
xii. Select the most suitable candidate.
xiii. Make an official offer.
Steps may overlap, so skip steps when appropriate. Each member of a hiring team
might have different responsibilities (e.g. recruiters source and hiring managers
interview candidates.)
Throughout this process, we aim to keep candidates informed, communicate well with
each other and give everyone an equal opportunity to work with us. Ask our recruiters
for help whenever you need to enhance candidate experience or write an inclusive job
description.
Background checks
If you want to run background checks on candidates, ask HR for guidance. This process
is sensitive and we must always abide by laws and ensure candidates understand our
intentions. As a general rule, commission a background check for finalists only. Use our
contracted provider and ensure you have your candidates’ permission.
Referrals
If you know someone who you think would be a good fit for a position at our company,
feel free to refer them. If we end up hiring your referred candidate, you are eligible for
[$3000] referral bonus or [a trip to a destination of your choice/ Amazon coupons.] Our
employee referral rewards may be higher if we hire your referred candidate in a hard-to-
fill role. For example, if we hire your referral for the position of [Data Scientist], you may
receive [$6000.]
Additional rules for rewards:
■ We guarantee that every reward will be paid out within [a month] of the date we
hired a candidate.
■ There is no cap on the number of referrals an employee can make. All rewards
will be paid accordingly.
■ If two or more employees refer the same candidate, only the first referrer will
receive the referral incentives.
■ Referrers are still eligible for rewards even if a candidate is hired at a later time or
gets hired for another position.
Who can be referred?
We have two conditions for candidates who can qualify you for our rewards. They
should:
■ Have not applied to our company for at least a year.
■ Be hired as permanent full- or part-time employees (not as temporary employees
or contractors.)
Our company may use an online form or a platform where employees may refer
candidates. You can also reach out directly to our [HR/recruiters/Talent Acquisition
Manager] with referrals.
Generally, we encourage you to check our open positions and consider your social
networks and external networks as potential resources for referred candidates.
Keep in mind that rewards may be subject to taxation. Please contact HR or our referral
program manager for more information.
Attendance
We expect you to be present during your scheduled working hours. If you face an
emergency that prevents you from coming to work one day, contact your manager as
soon as possible. We will excuse unreported absences in cases of [serious accidents,
acute medical emergencies.] But, whenever possible, we should know when you won’t
be coming in.
Workplace policies
This section describes policies that apply to everyone at our company: employees,
contractors, volunteers, vendors and stakeholders alike. These policies help us build a
productive, lawful and pleasant workplace.
Confidentiality and data protection
We want to ensure that private information about clients, employees, partners and our
company is well-protected. Examples of confidential information are:
■ Employee records
■ Unpublished financial information
■ Data of customers/partners/vendors
■ Customer lists (existing and prospective)
■ Unpublished goals, forecasts and initiatives marked as confidential
As part of our hiring process, we may ask you to sign non-compete and non-disclosure
agreements (NDAs.) We are also committed to:
■ Restrict and monitor access to sensitive data.
■ Develop transparent data collection procedures.
■ Train employees in online privacy and security measures.
■ Build secure networks to protect online data from cyberattacks.
■ Establish data protection practices (e.g. secure locks, data encryption, frequent
backups, access authorization.)
We also expect you to act responsibly when handling confidential information.
You must:
■ Lock or secure confidential information at all times.
■ Shred confidential documents when they’re no longer needed.
■ Make sure you view confidential information on secure devices only.
■ Only disclose information to other employees when it’s necessary and
authorized.
■ Keep confidential documents inside our company’s premises unless it’s
absolutely necessary to move them.
You must not:
■ Use confidential information for your personal benefit or profit.
■ Disclose confidential information to anyone outside of our company.
■ Replicate confidential documents and files and store them on insecure devices.
This policy is important for our company’s legality and reputation. We will terminate any
employee who breaches our confidentiality guidelines for personal profit.
We may also discipline any unintentional breach of this policy depending on its
frequency and seriousness. We will terminate employees who repeatedly disregard this
policy, even when they do so unintentionally.
Harassment and violence
To build a happy and productive workplace, we need everyone to treat others well and
help them feel safe. Each of us should do our part to prevent harassment and
workplace violence.
Workplace harassment
Harassment is a broad term and may include seemingly harmless actions, like gossip.
We can’t create an exhaustive list, but here are some instances that we consider
harassment:
■ [Sabotaging someone’s work on purpose.]
■ [Engaging in frequent or unwanted advances of any nature.]
■ [Commenting derogatorily on a person’s ethnic heritage or religious beliefs.]
■ [Starting or spreading rumors about a person’s personal life.]
■ [Ridiculing someone in front of others or singling them out to perform tasks
unrelated to their job (e.g. bringing coffee) against their will.]
Sexual harassment is illegal and we will seriously investigate relevant reports. If an
employee is found guilty of sexual harassment, they will be terminated.
If you’re being harassed, whether by a colleague, customer or vendor, you can choose
to talk to any of these people:
■ Offenders. If you suspect that an offender doesn’t realize they are guilty of
harassment, you could talk to them directly in an effort to resolve the harassment.
This tactic is appropriate for cases of minor harassment (e.g. inappropriate jokes
between colleagues.) Avoid using this approach with customers or stakeholders.
■ Your manager. If customers, stakeholders or team members are involved in your
claim, you may reach out to your manager. Your manager will assess your
situation and may contact HR if appropriate.
■ HR. Feel free to reach out to HR in any case of harassment no matter how minor
it may seem. For your safety, contact HR as soon as possible in cases of serious
harassment (e.g. sexual advances) or if your manager is involved in your claim.
Anything you disclose will remain confidential.
Workplace violence
Violence in our workplace is a serious form of harassment. It includes physical and
sexual assault, destruction of property, threats to harm a person or property and verbal
and psychological abuse. We want to avoid those incidents altogether, but we also want
to be ready to respond if needed.
For this reason, we ask you to:
■ [Report to HR if you suspect or know that someone is being violent. Your report
will be confidential and we will investigate the situation with discretion.]
■ [Call our building’s security if you witness incidents of severe physical violence
(e.g. ones that involve a lethal weapon.) For your safety, avoid getting involved.]
We will treat employees who verbally threaten others as high risk and they will receive
an appropriate penalty. If HR finds that an employee commits an act of violence, we will
terminate that employee and possibly press criminal charges. Employees who damage
property deliberately will be solely responsible for paying for it.
Supporting victims
To support victims of workplace violence, we may:
■ [Cover relevant medical bills.]
■ [Pay for mental health treatment if needed.]
■ [Provide victims with our lawyer’s services to help them file lawsuits.]
Get help early on
Seek help from others early on to mitigate conflicts. For example:
■ If you experience conflicts with a colleague, ask your manager for advice before
tensions escalate. If these conflicts persist, ask HR whether you could attend
conflict resolution seminars with your colleague.
■ If you are experiencing personal or work troubles, ask for help from a [mental
health professional.] Check with your insurance provider to determine whether
they cover any mental health services or ask HR for information on our Employee
Assistance Program (EAP). Your discussions will remain confidential.
Our workplace is founded on mutual respect and we won’t allow anyone to compromise
this foundation.
Workplace safety and health
Our company is committed to creating a hazard-free workplace. To this end, we will
ensure workplace safety through preventative action and emergency management.
Preventative action
Preventative actions are any actions we take to avoid injuries or illnesses related to the
workplace. We will periodically conduct risk assessments and job hazard analyses
[through a workplace safety committee] to uncover health risks to employees. And we
will establish preventative measures to address risks accordingly.
At a minimum, we will:
■ [Hold employee training sessions on safety standards and procedures.]
■ [Make sure employees who work in dangerous locations are safe.]
■ [Provide protective gear like gloves, protective uniforms and goggles.]
■ [Direct inspectors and quality control employees to evaluate equipment and
infrastructure regularly.]
We also expect you to take safety seriously. Always use protective equipment and
follow standards whenever necessary. If you deliberately disregard our guidelines, we
may terminate you for your own and others’ safety.
Emergency management
Emergency management refers to our plan to deal with sudden catastrophes like fire,
floods, earthquakes or explosions. Our emergency management provisions include:
■ [Functional smoke alarms and sprinklers that are regularly inspected.]
■ [Technicians (external or internal) available to repair leakages, damages and
blackouts quickly.]
■ [Fire extinguishers and other fire protection equipment that are easily accessible.]
■ [An evacuation plan posted on each floor and online.]
■ [Fire escapes and safety exits that are clearly indicated.]
Smoking
[Company’s name] is a smoke-free workplace. You can smoke in [designated smoking
areas, balconies, open-air verandas and outer premises, like gardens and sidewalks.]
Any other area in our workplace (like restrooms, lobby, offices, staircases, warehouses)
is strictly smoke-free to protect non-smokers.
We also advise you to:
■ Extinguish your cigarettes and discard them in [outdoor ashtrays, cigarette urns.]
■ Avoid smoking when you have scheduled meetings with clients or vendors.
■ Avoid smoking near flammable objects and areas.
Setting off fire alarms and causing fires by smoking are serious offenses. If you are
found responsible, you may face disciplinary action up to and including termination.
Drug-free workplace
[Company’s name] is a drug-free workplace. Whether you are an employee, contractor
or visitor, you must not bring, use, give away or sell any drugs on company premises. If
you are caught with illegal drugs, or show that you are under the influence of
substances, you will face disciplinary action up to and including termination.
A list of prohibited drugs and substances includes, but isn’t limited to:
■ [heroin/cocaine/methamphetamine in any form]
■ [marijuana]
Alcohol
We prohibit employees from consuming alcohol during working hours, but they may
consume alcoholic drinks in moderation at company events.
Prescription drugs
If you feel that a prescription drug (e.g. an anxiety mediation) unexpectedly affects your
senses, thinking or movement, ask for the rest of your day off. If your manager suspects
substance abuse, you may face disciplinary action.
You [must not] use medical marijuana in our workplace. We have the right to terminate
you if your off-duty use of medical marijuana makes you unable to complete your job
duties correctly.
We expect employees who hold safety-sensitive jobs (e.g. machine operators or
drivers) to be fully alert and capable of performing their duties at all times. We may
terminate you if we conclude your prescription drug use creates severe safety risks. If
you need to use prescription drugs for a limited time and you think they may impair your
abilities, use your PTO or sick leave.
If your job includes secondary tasks that are safety-sensitive and your prescribed drugs
affect your ability to perform these tasks, we can make reasonable accommodations to
ensure you and your colleagues’ safety.
Dealing with addiction
Being sober is a prerequisite to thriving at our company and we want to help you as
much as possible. We offer Employee Assistance Programs (EAP) that can help
employees overcome addictions. If you face a relevant problem, please reach out to our
[EAP Officer.]
We won’t tolerate substance addiction that results in violent, offensive or inappropriate
behavior.
Employee Code of Conduct
As an employee, all company policies mentioned above apply to you. We have some
additional expectations about your behavior at work, which we outline here. We can’t
cover every single case of conduct, but we trust you to always use your best judgement.
Reach out to your manager or HR if you face any issues or have any questions.
Dress code
Our company’s official dress code is [Business/ Business Casual/ Smart Casual/
Casual.] This includes [slacks/ loafers/ blouses/ boots.] However, an employee’s
position may also inform how they should dress. If you frequently meet with clients or
prospects, conform to a more formal dress code. We expect you to be clean when
coming to work and avoid wearing clothes that are unprofessional (e.g. workout
clothes.)
As long as you conform with our guidelines above, we don’t have specific expectations
about what types of clothes or accessories you should wear.
We also respect and permit grooming styles, clothing and accessories that are dictated
by religious beliefs, ethnicity or disability.
Cyber security and digital devices
This section deals with all things digital at work. We want to set some guidelines for
using computers, phones, our internet connection and social media to ensure security
and protect our assets.
Internet usage
Our corporate internet connection is primarily for business. But, you can occasionally
use our connection for personal purposes as long as they don’t interfere with your job
responsibilities. Also, we expect you to temporarily halt personal activities that slow
down our internet connection (e.g. uploading photos) if you’re asked to.
You must not use our internet connection to:
■ Download or upload obscene, offensive or illegal material.
■ Send confidential information to unauthorized recipients.
■ Invade another person’s privacy and gain access to sensitive information.
■ Download or upload pirated movies, music, material or software.
■ Visit potentially dangerous websites that can compromise our network and
computers’ safety.
■ Perform unauthorized or illegal actions, like hacking, fraud or buying/selling illegal
goods.
Cell phone
We allow use of cell phones at work. But, we also want to ensure that your devices
won’t distract you from your work or disrupt our workplace. We ask you to follow a few
simple rules:
■ Use your cell phone in a manner that benefits your work (business calls,
productivity apps, calendars.)
■ Keep personal calls brief and use an empty meeting room or common area so as
not to disturb your colleagues.
■ Avoid playing games on your phone or texting excessively.
■ Avoid using your phone for any reason while driving a company vehicle.
■ Don’t use your phone to record confidential information.
■ Don’t download or upload inappropriate, illegal or obscene material using our
corporate internet connection.
Also, you must not use your phone in areas where cell phone use is explicitly prohibited
(e.g. laboratories.)
Corporate email
Email is essential to our work. You should use your company email primarily for work,
but we allow some uses of your company email for personal reasons.
■ Work-related use. You can use your corporate email for work-related purposes
without limitations. For example, you can sign up for newsletters and online
services that will help you in your job or professional growth.
■ Personal use. You can use your email for personal reasons as long as you keep
it safe, and avoid spamming and disclosing confidential information. For example,
you can send emails to friends and family and download ebooks, guides and
other safe content for your personal use.
Our general expectations
No matter how you use your corporate email, we expect you to avoid:
■ Signing up for illegal, unreliable, disreputable or suspect websites and services.
■ Sending unauthorized marketing content or emails.
■ Registering for a competitor’s services, unless authorized.
■ Sending insulting or discriminatory messages and content.
■ Intentionally spamming other people’s emails, including your coworkers.
In general, use strong passwords and be vigilant in catching emails that carry malware
or phishing attempts. If you are not sure that an email you received is safe, ask our
[Security Specialists.]
Social media
We want to provide practical advice to prevent careless use of social media in our
workplace.
We address two types of social media uses: using personal social media at work and
representing our company through social media.
Using personal social media at work
You are permitted to access your personal accounts at work. But, we expect you to act
responsibly, according to our policies and ensure that you stay productive. Specifically,
we ask you to:
■ Discipline yourself. Avoid getting sidetracked by your social platforms.
■ Ensure others know that your personal account or statements don’t
represent our company. For example, use a disclaimer such as “opinions are
my own.”
■ Avoid sharing intellectual property (e.g trademarks) or confidential
information. Ask your manager or PR first before you share company news
that’s not officially announced.
■ Avoid any defamatory, offensive or derogatory content. You may violate our
company’s anti-harassment policy if you direct such content towards colleagues,
clients or partners.
Representing our company through social media
If you handle our social media accounts or speak on our company’s behalf, we expect
you to protect our company’s image and reputation. Specifically, you should:
■ Be respectful, polite and patient.
■ Avoid speaking on matters outside your field of expertise when possible.
■ Follow our confidentiality and data protection policies and observe laws
governing copyrights, trademarks, plagiarism and fair use.
■ Coordinate with our [PR/Marketing department] when you’re about to share any
major-impact content.
■ Avoid deleting or ignoring comments for no reason.
■ Correct or remove any misleading or false content as quickly as possible.
Conflict of interest
When you are experiencing a conflict of interest, your personal goals are no longer
aligned with your responsibilities towards us. For example, accepting a bribe may
benefit you financially, but it is illegal and against our business code of ethics. If we
become aware of such behaviour, you will lose your job and may face legal trouble.
For this reason, conflicts of interest are a serious issue for all of us. We expect you to
be vigilant to spot circumstances that create conflicts of interest, either to yourself or for
your direct reports. Follow our policies and always act in our company’s best interests.
Whenever possible, do not let personal or financial interests get in the way of your job. If
you are experiencing an ethical dilemma, talk to your manager or HR and we will try to
help you resolve it.
Employee relationships
We want to ensure that relationships between employees are appropriate and
harmonious. We outline our guidelines and we ask you to always behave professionally.
Fraternization
Fraternization refers to dating or being friends with your colleagues. In this policy,
“dating” equals consensual romantic relationships and sexual relations. Non-consensual
relationships constitute sexual violence and we prohibit them explicitly.
Dating colleagues
If you start dating a colleague, we expect you to maintain professionalism and keep
personal discussions outside of our workplace.
You are also obliged to respect your colleagues who date each other. We won’t tolerate
sexual jokes, malicious gossip and improper comments. If you witness this kind of
behavior, please report it to HR.
Dating managers
To avoid accusations of favoritism, abuse of authority and sexual harassment,
supervisors must not date their direct reports. This restriction extends to every manager
above an employee.
Also, if you act as a hiring manager, you aren’t allowed to hire your partner to your
team. You can refer them for employment to other teams or departments where you
don’t have any managerial or hiring authority.
Friendships at work
Employees who work together may naturally form friendships either in or outside of the
workplace. We encourage this relationship between peers, as it can help you
communicate and collaborate. But, we expect you to focus on your work and keep
personal disputes outside of our workplace.
Employment of relatives
Everyone in our company should be hired, recognized or promoted because of their
skills, character and work ethic. We would not like to see phenomena of nepotism,
favoritism or conflicts of interest, so we will place some restrictions on hiring employees’
relatives.
To our company, a “relative” is someone who is related by blood or marriage within the
third degree to an employee. This includes: parents, grandparents, in-laws, spouses or
domestic partners, children, grandchildren, siblings, uncles, aunts, nieces, nephews,
step-parents, step-children and adopted children.
As an employee, you can refer your relatives to work with our company. Here are our
only restrictions:
■ [You must not be involved in a supervisory/reporting relationship with a relative.]
■ [You cannot be transferred, promoted or hired inside a reporting relationship with
a relative.]
■ [You cannot be part of a hiring committee, when your relative is interviewed for
that position.]
If you become related to a manager or direct report after you both become employed by
our company, we may have to [transfer one of you.]
Workplace visitors
If you want to invite a visitor to our offices, please ask for permission from our [HR
Manager/ Security Officer/ Office Manager] first. Also, inform our [reception/ gate/ front-
office] of your visitor’s arrival. Visitors should sign in and show identification. They will
receive passes and will be asked to return them to [reception/ gate/ front-office] once
their visit is complete.
When you have office visitors, you also have responsibilities. You should:
■ Always tend to your visitors (especially when they are underage.)
■ Keep your visitors away from areas where there are dangerous machines,
chemicals, confidential records or sensitive equipment.
■ Prevent your visitors from proselytizing your colleagues, gathering donations or
requesting participation in activities while on our premises.
Anyone who delivers orders, mail or packages for employees should remain at our
building’s reception or gate. If you are expecting a delivery, [front office employees/
security guards] will notify you so you may collect it.
Solicitation and distribution
Solicitation is any form of requesting money, support or participation for products,
groups, organizations or causes which are unrelated to our company (e.g. religious
proselytism, asking for petition signatures.) Distribution means disseminating literature
or material for commercial or political purposes.
We don’t allow solicitation and distribution by non-employees in our workplace. As an
employee, you may solicit from your colleagues only when you want to:
■ Ask colleagues to help organize events for another employee (e.g. adoption/birth
of a child, promotion, retiring.)
■ Seek support for a cause, charity or fundraising event sponsored, funded,
organized or authorized by our company.
■ Invite colleagues to employee activities for an authorized non-business purpose
(e.g. recreation, volunteering.)
■ Ask colleagues to participate in employment-related activities or groups protected
by law (e.g. trade unions.)
In all cases, we ask that you do not disturb or distract colleagues from their work.
Compensation & development
In this section, we outline our guidelines for compensating employees according to their
employment status. We also describe our performance management and employee
development policies.
Compensation status
[Insert this section if you are covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) in the
U.S.]
There are two types of employees under FLSA guidelines:
■ Non-exempt employees, who are covered by the FLSA’s minimum wage and
overtime provisions.
■ Exempt employees, who aren’t covered by the FLSA because they meet three
exemption criteria: (a) they are paid at least [$23,600] per year ([$455] per week),
(b) they are paid on a salary basis, and (c) they perform exempt job duties
("executive," "professional" and "administrative.") Most employees must meet all
three criteria to be exempt.
If you are unsure as to whether you should be exempt or not, please ask HR to clarify
your status.
The FLSA excludes some types of jobs (e.g. railroad workers, truck drivers) because
they are covered by other federal laws. Some other workers, like outside salespeople,
are excluded by definition. Feel free to ask HR for clarifications any time.
Overtime
Occasionally, we may need you to work more than your regular working hours. We will
pay for overtime work according to local and national laws.
[Insert this if employees are in the U.S: If you are an exempt employee, you are not
entitled to overtime pay by federal law. In the event that an exempt employee must work
overtime, we will set a cap for overtime hours at [10 hours per week] to prevent
overworking and burnout.
If you are a non-exempt employee, you are entitled to overtime pay of one and a half
times your wage. Please record your overtime hours accurately, so we can calculate
your pay correctly. We also ask you to work overtime only after it’s authorized by your
supervisor to make our record-keeping easier.]
Payroll
We pay your salary or wage [at the end of month/ every 15th and end of month] by
[checks/ bank transfers/ cash.] If you are an hourly employee, you should be diligent [in
clocking in and out/using our timesheet software] so we can accurately calculate your
pay.
Performance management
We have built our performance management practices to:
■ Ensure you understand your job responsibilities and have specific goals to meet.
■ Provide you with actionable and timely feedback on your work.
■ Invest in development opportunities that help you grow professionally.
■ Recognize and reward your work in financial or non-financial ways (e.g.
employee awards.)
To meet these objectives, we have:
■ Established [annual/ bi-annual/ quarterly] performance reviews. During these
reviews, your manager will fill out your performance evaluation report and
arrange a meeting with you to discuss it. Through these discussions, managers
aim to recognize employees who are good at their jobs, identify areas of
improvement and talk about career moves. Pay increases or bonuses are not
guaranteed. But, we encourage managers to recommend rewards for their team
members when they deserve them. There won’t be any forced ranking or other
comparison between employees, as our goal is to help all employees improve
and develop their careers.
■ Instructed all managers to meet with their team members once per [week] to
provide feedback and talk about their work and motivations. This way, you can
receive feedback in a timely manner and avoid surprises during your [annual/ bi-
annual/ quarterly] performance review.
How we expect managers to lead employees
If you manage a team, you are responsible for your team members’ performance. To
conduct effective regular meetings and performance evaluations, we expect you to:
■ Set clear objectives. Your team members should know what you expect of
them. When you first hire someone to your team, ensure they understand their
job duties. Set specific goals for each team member (and team-wide if
applicable.) Revisit those goals during [annual/ bi-annual/ quarterly] performance
reviews.
■ Provide useful feedback. During scheduled meetings with your team members,
give them both guidance and praise, as appropriate. Be fair and specific to help
them understand and implement your feedback.
■ Keep your team members involved. There should be two-way communication
between you and your team. Make your expectations clear, but always take your
team members’ motivations and aspirations into account. Discuss training and
development opportunities that may interest your team members.
■ Keep logs with important incidents about each one of your team members.
These logs help you evaluate your team, but may also prove useful when
rewarding, promoting or terminating your team members.
Employee training and development
We owe our success to our employees. To show our gratitude, we will invest in our
employees professional development. We want employees to feel confident about
improving their efficiency and productivity. We also want to help our employees achieve
personal growth and success.
Each employee has [$1,000] annually to spend on educational activities or material.
Subscriptions and books are included in this budget, unless they are necessary for you
to complete your everyday duties. Send your expenses to HR [by email/ expenses
software.]
Apart from online courses, we offer these training opportunities:
■ Formal training sessions (individual or corporate.)
■ Employee coaching and mentoring.
■ Seats at industry conferences.
■ On-the-job training.
■ Job shadowing.
■ Job rotation.
Development is a collective process. Team members and managers should regularly
discuss learning needs and opportunities. And it’s HR’s responsibility to facilitate any
development activities and processes.
Benefits and perks
In this section, we describe what we offer to our employees. We provide information on
our health insurance plans and benefits like work from home options and company-
issued equipment.
Employee health
Employee health is important to us. We don’t discriminate against people with
disabilities or health conditions, but we want to do everything possible to help
employees stay healthy. At a minimum, we provide [group health insurance] to all
eligible employees. For more information about our insurance package, contact HR.
[Insert this if you have more than 20 employees in the U.S: According to the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA), you may choose to
continue your group health benefits for a limited period after leaving our company. This
can happen after you experience a qualifying event, i.e. termination for reasons other
than gross misconduct and reduction in your hours of employment. Covered spouses
and children may also be able to extend their health coverage after certain qualifying
events. Please ask HR for guidance.]
We have also established non-smoking and substance abuse policies to protect
employee health. We will create a workplace with minimal noise and good lighting and
offer [free healthy snacks, wellness programs.]
Workers’ compensation
We strive to keep our workplace safe, but accidents may happen occasionally.
Employees who are injured at work (by accident or disease) can receive wage
replacement, medical care and rehabilitation benefits according to workers’
compensation laws, when appropriate. Please inform us of your injury as soon as
possible. Ask HR for forms that you need to file a claim or contact your state agency for
workers’ compensation.
Our company has a workers’ compensation policy according to guidelines of the states
(or countries) we operate in. [Insert summary of your workers compensation insurance
packages and details on who will handle workers’ compensation when employees are
injured. If you operate in multiple states or countries, mention any specific guidelines
and, if possible, provide employees with contact details of workers compensation
boards for the states or countries you operate in.]
Work from home
If your job doesn’t require you to be present at our premises, you can occasionally work
from home (WFH). We normally allow [one day per week.] If you need to telecommute
for more days per week, talk to your manager.
Please inform your manager that you want to work from home [using our HRIS] at least
[two days] in advance. [You can also set a recurring WFH day per week.] If there’s a
rare emergency, you may work from home without having received prior approval, but
call or email your manager as soon as possible. If they are in a different time-zone,
contact HR instead.
When you are working from home, please use an internet connection and devices that
are fast and secure. Choose a place without loud noises or distractions. And, check in
with your team frequently to make collaboration easier.
If there is inclement weather (e.g. a blizzard) please check your [email] to see if the
office is officially closed. If you judge that your commute during inclement weather is
dangerous, let us know. We will not force you to come to work if your safety is at stake
or if there is an official travel warning.
Remote working
Remote working refers to working from a non-office location on a temporary or
permanent basis.
If you’re an office-based employee, you may work remotely for a maximum of [two
consecutive weeks] per year. You may arrange this if you [are a new parent or suffer
from a short-term disability.] If you have another reason, talk to your manager. Submit
your remote working requests [through our HRIS] at least [one week] in advance.
If you work remotely permanently, we ask that you adhere to our security, confidentiality
and equal opportunity policies just like your office-based colleagues.
Employee expenses
There are some expenses that we will pay directly on your behalf (e.g. hotel rooms for
work-related travel.) But, we ask you to keep track and report on those reimbursable
expenses that you pay yourself. We reimburse employee expenses that are related to:
■ [Business travel]
■ [Relocation]
■ [Education and training]
■ [Upon approval, outings with business partners or colleagues]
Not all travel expenses are reimbursable. For example, we will pay for your
transportation to an airport for work-related travel, but not to a museum for a personal
visit. Before traveling for business, contact HR to clarify which expenses are
reimbursable within your particular trip.
Please keep receipts for all reimbursable expenses. You can submit them to your
manager [through our expense software] within [three months] after the date of each
expense. If your manager approves your expenses, you will receive your
reimbursement within [two] pay periods [by check.]
Company car
You may drive a company car if you:
■ Need it as an indispensable part of your job (e.g. truck drivers and delivery
drivers.)
■ Receive it as a benefit attached to your job.
Either way, your car belongs to our company. You may use your company vehicle for
personal reasons as our policy permits. You will get reimbursed only for approved,
business-related expenses.
To get a company car, you should have a valid driver’s license and a clean driving
record for at least [two years.] Drive safe and sober and respect traffic laws and fellow
motorists. You should also check your car regularly to ensure gas, tire pressure and all
car fluids are at appropriate levels.
We expect you to avoid:
■ Smoking in a company car.
■ Leasing, selling or lending a company car.
■ Using a company car to teach someone how to drive.
■ Leaving your company car unlocked, unattended or parked in dangerous areas.
■ Allowing unauthorized people to drive a company car, unless an emergency
mandates it.
On our part, we will ensure that our cars are safe and in good condition, as well as
appropriately insured.
Accidents
If you are involved in an accident with a company car, contact our HR department
immediately, so we can get in touch with our insurance provider. You shouldn’t accept
responsibility or guarantee payment to another person without authorization.
Follow this policy’s guidelines to avoid disciplinary action. For minor offenses, like
allowing unauthorized people to drive a company car, we will reprimand you or reclaim
your car. But for more serious offenses, like causing an accident while intoxicated, we
may terminate you.
Parking
We will prioritize parking space assignments for [employees with disabilities, executives
and employees who drive company vehicles.] We will then allocate our remaining
parking spaces on a first-come, first-served basis. Interns and trainees may also receive
parking spaces. If you want to receive a parking spot, file your request with our [HR
department/ facilities manager.]
We expect you to keep our parking lot clean and use only your assigned space. Please
behave responsibly to avoid causing damage, injury or loss of property.
We will not assume any liability for theft, vandalism, fire or damage regarding an
employee’s vehicle in our parking lot.
Company-issued equipment
As an employee, you may receive [company cell phone, laptop or other device,
furniture.] Unless otherwise mentioned in your contract, any equipment we offer belongs
to our company and you may not sell it or give it away. You are also responsible for
keeping our equipment safe and in as good condition as possible. If your equipment
breaks or malfunctions, let us know so we can arrange to get it repaired.
If you are part of our corporate cell phone plan, please use your phone within our plan’s
restraints. You may have to pay any extra charges yourself.
Theft and damage of company equipment
Our equipment is insured for theft and damage. We ask you to inform us within [24
hours] if your equipment is stolen or damaged. We might be able to trace stolen laptops
and cell phones. Please also file a theft statement (affidavit) with the police and submit
a copy to us.
Security of company issued devices
We advise you to keep your company-issued computer, tablet and cell phone secure.
You can do this if you:
■ Keep all devices password-protected.
■ Ensure you do not leave your devices unattended.
■ Install security updates for browsers and other systems as soon as updates are
available.
■ Log into company accounts and systems through secure and private networks
only.
■ Follow all instructions for disk encryption, anti-malware protection and password
management that you received along with your equipment.
Time
In this section, we explain our provisions for your working hours and time off. We
include [five] types of leave and holidays.
Working hours
Our company operates between [9 a.m. to 7 p.m. on weekdays.] You may come to work
at any time between [9 a.m. and 11 a.m.], depending on your team’s needs.
Some departments may work after hours, too [(e.g. customer support, shipping.)] If you
work in these departments, you will follow a shift schedule as needed.
Paid time off (PTO)
Employees receive [20 days] of Paid Time Off (PTO) per year. You PTO accrual begins
the day you join our company and you receive [1.7 days per month.] You can take your
PTO at any time after your first [week] with us and you [can] use time off you haven’t
accrued yet. You will earn one additional day per year after your [first year] with our
company, with a cap at [25 days overall.]
If you want to use PTO, send a request [through our HRIS.] If your manager or HR
approves, you are permitted to take your leave. You do not have to specify a reason for
requesting PTO.
You [can/cannot] transfer any remaining PTO to the next year. We encourage you to
use your time off throughout the year.
If you leave our company, we may compensate accrued PTO with your final paycheck
according to local law. When the law doesn’t have provisions, we will compensate
accrued leave to employees who were not terminated for cause.
Holidays
Our company observes the following holidays:
■ [New Year’s Day]
■ [Martin Luther King Day]
■ [President’s Day]
■ [Good Friday/Easter Monday]
■ [Memorial Day]
■ [Independence Day]
■ [Labor Day]
■ [Columbus Day]
■ [Veterans Day]
■ [Thanksgiving Day]
■ [Christmas Day]
If a holiday falls on a day when our company doesn’t operate (e.g. Sunday), we will
observe that holiday on the closest business day.
Our company offers a floating day, which you can take as a holiday any day you
choose. If you want to observe a religious holiday that isn’t included in our list, we may
allow you to take unpaid time off for that day. Or, you may use your PTO.
Holiday pay
■ Exempt employees are entitled to their normal compensation without any
deductions.
■ Permanent non-exempt employees receive holiday pay as a benefit after they
have worked with us for more than [three months.]
Working on a holiday
These holidays are considered “off-days” for most employees. If you need a team
member to work on a holiday, inform them at least [three days] in advance.
If you are a non-exempt employee, you will receive your regular hourly rate with a
premium for working on a holiday. If you are an exempt employee, we will grant you an
additional day of PTO that you must take within [12 months] after that holiday.
We [will/ won’t] count hours you worked on a holiday to decide whether you are entitled
to overtime pay.
Sick leave
We offer [one week] of [paid] sick leave. In states or countries where employees are
entitled to a greater number of sick leave days by law, we will follow that law. You can
take sick leave to recover from short-term illness, injuries, mental issues and other
indisposition. If you have the flu or other contagious disease, please use your sick days.
If you become sick, inform your manager and send a sick leave request [through our
HRIS.] You may take a partial day off or work from home, but we advise you to rest and
recuperate for a day before returning to work.
Use your PTO or arrange for a flexible work schedule if you want to attend routine
health care (e.g. doctor’s/dentist’s appointments.)
Occasionally, we may ask you to submit a physician’s note or other medical certification
and/or complete a sick leave form. We will do this for insurance purposes if you are
absent for more than [three days] of sick leave.
Long-term illness
[Insert this section in your handbook if you employ 50 or more employees in the U.S.:
The U.S. Family and Medical Leave Act provides employees 12 weeks of unpaid, job-
protected leave in a 12-month period with the same group health benefits for medical
and family reasons. One of those reasons is to recover from a serious health condition
or to care for an immediate family member with a serious health condition.
You are eligible for this type of leave if you have worked for us for more than 12 months
and you have worked at least 1,250 hours within 12 months before your leave begins.
Contact HR for more information when needed.]
Bereavement leave
Losing a loved one is traumatizing. If this happens to you while you work with us, we
want to support you and give you time to cope and mourn.
For this reason, we offer [three days] of paid bereavement leave. You may take your
bereavement leave on [consecutive/non-consecutive] days to:
■ Arrange a funeral or memorial service.
■ Attend a funeral or memorial service.
■ Resolve matters of inheritance.
■ Fulfill other family obligations.
■ Mourn.
If you have to travel long-distance for a funeral or service, you can take [two] additional
unpaid days off. If you require more time, please use your PTO.
Jury duty and voting
If you are called for jury duty and you are an exempt employee, you can take [one day]
off without deduction from your salary. If local or national law stipulates more days of
paid jury duty leave, we will follow the law. On election day, you can take [two hours] off
to vote. You can take [a paid half-day off] if you need to travel a short distance to vote. If
your trip lasts more days, please use your PTO.
Hourly employees may take [one unpaid day] off for jury duty and voting. If local or
national law obliges us to provide hourly employees with paid jury duty leave, we will
follow the law.
To keep good records, we ask you to bring us [a copy of your summons for jury duty
and a document that proves you served.]
Parental leave
Caring for a newborn is an exciting time for parents. We want to support new mothers
and fathers in their first months of parenthood with paternity and maternity leave.
Afterwards, we will continue to support parents with [flexible work options and child
care.]
Paternity and maternity leave
[Insert this if you’re covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA): The FMLA
provides eligible employees with 12-weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for the birth or
adoption of a child.You are eligible for this type of leave if you have worked for us for
more than 12 months and you have worked at least 1,250 hours within 12 months
before your leave begins. Contact HR for more information when needed.]
Our company offers [three months] of paid maternity and paternity leave. If local or
national law stipulates longer leave, we will follow the law.
If you are about to be a new mother or father (either through childbirth or adoption), talk
to HR to arrange your leave. Please give us at least [three months] notice before your
leave begins.
Depending on local or national law, pregnant women can take part of their leave before
labor. If you suffer complications during childbirth or have other issues, you can ask for
an unpaid leave extension of up to [two months.] Contact HR as soon as possible to
arrange this.
Returning to work after parental leave
We are committed to helping new parents transition back to work after their leave ends.
We offer:
■ [Remote working/ Flexible hours.]
■ [Onsite/ External paid day care.]
■ [Lactation rooms.]
Leaving our company
In this section, we describe our procedures regarding resignation and termination of our
employees. We also refer to our progressive discipline process that may sometimes
result in termination.
[Insert this if employees are in the U.S: We remind you that in the U.S. employment is
“at-will.” This means that you or our company may terminate our employment
relationship at any time and for any non-discriminatory reason.]
Progressive discipline
Here we outline steps we will take to address employee misconduct. We want to give
employees a chance to correct their behavior when possible and assist them in doing
so. We also want to ensure that we thoroughly investigate and handle serious offenses.
Our progressive discipline process has six steps of increasing severity. These steps
are:
i. Verbal warning
ii. Informal meeting with supervisor
iii. Formal reprimand
iv. Formal disciplinary meeting
v. Penalties
vi. Termination
Different offenses correspond to different steps in our disciplinary process. For example,
minor, one-time offenses (e.g. breach of our dress code policy) will trigger Step 1. More
severe violations (e.g. sexual harassment) will trigger step 5.
If you manage employees, inform them when you launch a progressive discipline
process. Pointing out a performance issue is not necessarily a verbal warning and may
be part of your regular feedback. If you judge that progressive discipline is appropriate,
let your team member know and ask HR to help you explain our full procedure.
Managers may skip or repeat steps at their discretion. Our company may treat
circumstances differently from that described in this policy. But, we are always obliged
to act fairly and lawfully and document every stage of our progressive discipline
process.
Keep in mind that our company isn’t obliged to follow the steps of our progressive
discipline process. As you are employed “at-will” in the U.S, we may terminate you
directly without launching a progressive discipline process. For serious offenses (e.g.
sexual harassment), we may terminate you without warning.
Resignation
You resign when you voluntarily inform HR or your manager that you will stop working
for our company. We also consider you resigned if you don’t come to work for [three]
consecutive days without notice.
You are not obliged to give us advance notice before resigning. But, for efficiency’s
sake, and to make sure our workplace runs smoothly, we ask that you give at least [two
weeks] notice, if possible. If you hold a highly specialized or executive position, we ask
that you give us at least [a month’s] notice, when possible.
We accept verbal resignations, but we prefer that you submit a written and signed
notice of resignation for our HR records. We will reply with an acceptance of resignation
letter within [two days.] HR will inform your manager that you are resigning if you
haven’t already done so. Whether you want to announce your resignation to your team
is up to you, but we encourage you to be open.
Tuition or relocation reimbursement
If you have relocated or studied at our company’s expense, you are bound by your
contract to remain with us for at least [two years.] If you resign before that period, you
may have to reimburse us for part or all of these expenses.
Forced resignation
You can resign anytime at your own free will and nobody should force you into
resignation. Forcing someone into resigning (directly or indirectly) is constructive
dismissal and we won’t tolerate it. Specifically, we prohibit employees from:
■ Creating a hostile or unpleasant environment.
■ Demanding or coaxing an employee to resign.
■ Victimizing, harassing or retaliating against an employee.
■ Forcing an employee to resign by taking unofficial adverse actions (e.g.
demotions, increased workload).
Termination
Terminating an employee is always unpleasant but sometimes necessary. If that
happens, we want to ensure we act lawfully and respectfully.
We may terminate an employee either for cause or without cause.
■ For cause termination is justified when an employee breaches their contract,
engages in illegal activities (e.g. embezzlement), disrupts our workplace (e.g.
harasses colleagues), performs below acceptable standards or causes damage
or financial loss to our company.
■ Without cause termination refers to redundancies or layoffs that may be
necessary if we cease some of our operations or re-assign job duties within
teams. We will follow applicable laws regarding notice and payouts.
We will offer severance pay to eligible employees. We may also help employees who
were terminated without cause to find work elsewhere, if possible.
We may also compensate accrued vacation and sick leave upon termination, depending
on local law. Whenever local law doesn’t have relevant stipulations, we will pay accrued
leave only to those who weren’t terminated for cause. We will also take into account
union agreements and abide by agreed terms.
If you manage team members, avoid wrongful dismissal. When you terminate an
employee for cause, we expect you to be certain you made the right choice and keep
accurate performance and/or disciplinary records to support your decision.
References
When we terminate employees, we may provide references for those who leave in good
standing. This means that employees shouldn’t have been terminated for cause. If you
are laid off, you may receive references. Please ask your manager.
If you resign, you may ask for references and your manager has a right to oblige or
refuse.
Policy revision
We will always strive for fairness and equal opportunity and penalize offensive and
illegal behaviors. But, as laws and our environment change, we may revise and modify
some of our policies.
We have established an [annual] revision of our handbook to bring it up to date with
legislation and employment trends. We also ask you to contact HR if you spot any
inconsistencies or mistakes. And, if you have any ideas about how to improve our
workplace, we are happy to hear them.
Employee acknowledgement
Please sign to acknowledge that you’ve read this handbook and that you are committed
to following our policies. If you need any clarifications, feel free to ask HR.

WHEREAS, the parties wish to assure confidentiality and prevent use of such information for purposes other than a Transaction;
NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valid consideration, including the mutual covenants and promises set forth herein, and intending to be bound, it is agreed:
1. The term “Confidential Information” means all business information, whether or not in writing, heretofore or hereafter provided by Nefab to the Supplier in connection
with consideration of, preparation for or execution of a Transaction, and all notes or writing made by the Supplier regarding the business of Nefab in connection with the
discussions referred to above, and includes without limitation, technical plans and specifications of Nefab and its customers, financial information, pricing and customer

Confidential Information, except (i) information that is in the public domain or hereafter becomes publicly available other than as a result of disclosure by the Supplier in
violation of this Agreement, (ii) information that was known to Supplier at the time of its disclosure as evidenced by business records of Supplier or that hereafter is

Agreement and to bind the respective party. This Agreement may be executed in counterpart by telecopy and shall be binding and effective upon execution by all of the

to any of Nefab’s customers whose information and/or identity has been made known to the Supplier by Nefab.

1.    Bonuses. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Company hereby agrees to pay to Employee six (__) consecutive cash bonus awards in the amount of $00.00 each, ($00.00 total) in each case less any applicable federal, state or local taxes that Company may be obligated to withhold or pay in connection with such payments and any other applicable withholdings (each a "Bonus" and collectively the "Bonuses"), as a short-term incentive bonus to Employee. Assuming satisfaction of the conditions described in this Agreement for payment, the Bonuses shall be earned on the dates set forth below (each a "Bonus Date") and shall be paid on Company's normal payroll dates immediately following the respective dates on which they are earned, as set forth below:

In the event Employee's employment with Company terminates for any reason other than death or disability, including, without limitation, any termination by Company for any reason, Employee shall have no right to any Bonus that otherwise would have been earned had Employee been employed with Company on any

Prior to Employee's receipt of payment of any Bonus, Employee's rights under this Agreement are not transferable other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. Any attempted sale, assignment, transfer, pledge, hypothecation or other disposition of, or the levy of execution, attachment or similar process upon, Employee's rights under this Agreement contrary to the provisions of this Section 4 shall be void and without effect.

5.    Section 409A Matters. It is Company's intent that the Bonuses shall not be considered "deferred compensation" subject to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, because, among other reasons, (a) each Bonus is subject to a "substantial risk of forfeiture" within the meaning of Section 1.409A-1(d) of the Treasury Regulations until the applicable Bonus Date for such Bonus; and (b) all Bonuses accordingly should qualify as short-term deferrals within the meaning of Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) of the Treasury Regulations. This Agreement shall be interpreted in whatever manner may be required to give effect to this provision.

6.    Amendments. This Agreement may be amended by a written agreement signed by Company and Employee; provided, however, that Company may modify the terms of this Agreement without the consent of Employee in any manner that is not adverse to Employee.
    
7.    Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect any other provision or any other jurisdiction, but this Agreement will be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein.

8.    Choice of Law. All questions concerning the construction, validity and interpretation of this Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Oklahoma, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Oklahoma or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Oklahoma.

9.    Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by Employee and Company and their respective permitted successors and assigns.

10.    Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in separate counterparts (including by means




of facsimile or other electronic media), each of which shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

The parties have executed and delivered this Short-Term Bonus Agreement to be effective for all purposes as of the date set forth above.

1. PARTIES
1.1 Q-linea AB (publ), corporate identity number 556729-0217, Dag
Hammarskjölds väg 52A, 752 37 Uppsala (the ”Company”); and

implement an employee stock option program (the ”Stock Option Program”)
for the employees of the Company as of 15 June 2021.
2.2 By ”Employee Stock Option” is meant, in this agreement, a right, but not an
obligation, for the Stock Option Holder to acquire, from the Company (or from
the entity advised by the Company), shares in the Company on the terms and
conditions set out in this agreement.
2.3 The Stock Option Holder has been offered to participate in the Stock Option
Program.

Options, each giving the Stock Option Holder the right to acquire one (1)
common share in the Company.
4. SUBSCRIPTION PRICE AND ALLOTMENT

Stock Option is exercised is onehundredandtwentyfive (125) per cent of the
volume-weighted average price for common shares in the Company according
to Nasdaq First North Growth Market's official price list during the period of ten
(10) trading days before the 25 May 2021 (the “Subscription Price”). The
Subscription Price may however not be lower than the quotient value of the
share. As stated in section 6 below, the Subscription Price and/or the number of
shares that each Employee Stock Option entitles to may be re-calculated.
4.2 The Employee Stock Options are vested under a period of three (3) years from
the date of this Agreement and allotted according to the following:
a) [ ] per cent of the Employee Stock Options are allotted when/if [ ];
b) an additional [ ] per cent of the Employee Stock Options are allotted
when/if [ ]; and
c) the remaining [ ] per cent of the Employee Stock Option are allotted
when/if [ ].
4.3 If the Stock Option Holder would pass away, the Stock Option Holder’s rights
according to these Employee Stock Options shall, to the extent that they have
been vested and allotted according to section 4.2, belong to the Stock Option
Holder’s beneficiaries; other non-allotted Employee Stock Options shall lapse.
5. CONDITIONS FOR EXERCISE
5.1 When the Stock Option Holder wishes to exercise the allotted Employee Stock
Options for subscription of shares, the Employee Stock Options shall be
exercised as set out below.
5.2 Subscription according to section 4.2a) above is conditional on the approval of
the board of directors.
5.3 The Stock Option Holder’s right to exercise the Employee Stock Options for
subscription of shares is, unless the board of directors resolves otherwise,
conditional on, firstly, that the conditions in this agreement are met (meaning
amongst other things that the Employee Stock Options have been vested and
allotted) and, secondly, that the Stock Option Holder’s employment in the
Company has not been terminated or that notice of such termination has not
been given prior to the exercise of the Employee Stock Options.
5.4 Exercise of the Employee Stock Options can be made during the period
commencing on the day that occurs three (3) years from the date of this
Agreement up to and including 23 September 2024 (the “Exercise Period”).

following occasions:
a) when an offer for the purchase of the Company’s shares has been
accepted to such extent that the offeror will become owner of more than
ninety (90) percent of the outstanding shares in the Company; or
b) when a resolution is made by the general meeting of shareholders in the
Company or by the Company’s board of directors, allowing exercise at
another point of time.
5.6 Exercise of the Employee Stock Options is made by submitting the notice in

Company will provide the Stock Option Holder with details regarding the bank
account to which the Subscription Price shall be paid. Payment of the
Subscription Price shall be made within five (5) business days of the date when
the Stock Option Holder sent a correctly filled out notice to the Company.

the shares in the Company and receival of the proceeds of the sale, the Stock
Option Holder shall, together with the notice of exercise, sign a power of
attorney for the bank in question.
6. RE-CALCULATION OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS ETC.
In case of a (i) share split, (ii) reverse share split, (iii) bonus issue, (iv) issue
with pre-emption rights for existing shareholders, and (v) certain other events,
the Subscription Price and/or the number of shares that each Employee Stock
Option entitles to may be re-calculated. For example, if a share split is made
where each share is divided into ten new shares, each Employee Stock Option
will entitle to subscription of ten shares instead of one share and consequently
for a tenth of the Subscription Price per share.
7. THE STOCK OPTION HOLDER’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITS TAX
SITUATION

consequences of the exercise of the Employee Stock Options. According to the

exercise) and the Subscription Price. The Parties agree that the Company does
not have any obligation to inform the Stock Option Holder regarding potential
changes of relevant tax rules. The Stock Option Holder is recommended, if
necessary, to seek advice with regards to his/her own tax situation.

with the provisions above at the expiration of the Exercise Period will lapse,
entailing that the Stock Option Holder’s possibility to exercise them to acquire
shares – as well as other rights connected to them – will lapse. The same shall

manner dispose of the Employee Stock Options or the rights and obligations
pursuant to this agreement.

Options in violation of the conditions in this agreement, all of the Employee

obligation to deliver shares according to this agreement.

circumstance that may affect the Party’s capacity to perform its obligations
under this agreement.

and be signed by both Parties to be binding. However, the Company has the
right to unilaterally make such minor amendments to the conditions in this
agreement as may be required to accomplish the purpose of the Stock Option
Program. The Stock Option Holder shall be informed of such amendments
without delay.

the content in and intentions behind the invalid provision.

Summary Narrative
(Use this space to summarize the matter being reported. A detailed narrative should be continued by attaching
additional pages, if necessary.)
Revised 8/10/17


Sample Harassment Policy:
The objective of [Company Name] to offer employment opportunity, based upon ability and performance in a
productive climate, free of discrimination and to provide a workplace in which employees are treated with dignity
and respect. Therefore, it is the policy of [Company Name] that any employee or supervisor shall not harass
another employee or member of the public.
H ARASSMENT
Harassment includes racial or ethnic slurs and other verbal, visual or physical abuse relating to a person’s race, age
religion, color, national origin, ancestry, sex, physical or mental handicap or medical condition. Harassment also
includes any other behavior that interferes with an individual’s work performance or creates an intimidating,
hostile, or offensive working environment.
Harassment of any kind of an employee will not be tolerated. Any employee experiencing or witnessing such
harassment shall report such instances immediately to their supervisor or the Human Resources Department.
Noncompliance with this policy by any employee may result in corrective or disciplinary action, including
termination.
No employee shall be subjected to any form of intimidation or threat of retaliation for exercising their rights under
the law or these policies.
SEXUAL HARASSMENT
It is the policy of [Company Name] to provide a work environment for its employees that is free from
discrimination and intimidation. [Company Name] will not tolerate any form of sexual harassment. Prompt
disciplinary action will be taken against an employee who commits or participates in any form of sexual
harassment.
Sexual harassment is defined as unwanted, unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other
verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature, which has the effect of creating an offensive, intimidating, degrading
or hostile work environment, or adversely interferes or affects an employee's work performance, or is made either
implicitly or explicitly a term or condition of an individual’s employment, or when submission or when submission
or rejection of such conduct is used as the basis for employment decision of the individual.
Though sexual harassment encompasses a wide range of conduct, some examples of specifically prohibited
conduct include the following:
• Physical assaults of a sexual nature, such as rape, sexual battery, molestation or attempts to commit these
assaults, and intentional physical conduct that is sexual in nature, such as touching, pinching, patting,
grabbing, brushing against another employee's body or poking another employee's body.
• Unwelcome sexual advances, propositions or other sexual comments, such as sexually oriented gestures,
noises, remarks, jokes or comments about a person's sexuality or sexual experience.
• Preferential treatment or promises of preferential treatment to an employee for submitting to sexual
conduct, including soliciting or attempting to solicit any employee to engage in sexual activity for
compensation or reward.
• Subjecting, or threats of subjecting, an employee to unwelcome sexual attention or conduct or
intentionally making performance of the employee's job more difficult because of that employee's sex.
• Sexual or discriminatory displays or publications anywhere in [Company Name]'s workplace by the
[Company Name] employees.
• Retaliation for sexual harassment complaints.
Repeated incidents or an aggregation of incidents can constitute sexual harassment even if one incident
considered on its own would not be harassing.
If an employee believes that he or she has been subject to sexual harassment or any unwelcome sexual attention,
he or she may address the situation directly and immediately to the harasser, if possible. If the inappropriate
conduct does not cease, or if the employee is unable to or uncomfortable with addressing the alleged harasser
directly, he or she should report the incident to his or her own supervisor or manager, or to the human resource
department.
It is important to report any and all concerns of sexual harassment or inappropriate sexual conduct to the human
resource department or a supervisor/manager as soon as possible. Management must be made aware of the
situation so that it can conduct an immediate and impartial investigation and take appropriate action to remediate
or prevent the prohibited conduct from continuing.
Managers and supervisors must deal expeditiously and fairly with allegations of sexual harassment within their
departments whether or not there has been a written or formal complaint. They must:
• Take all complaints or concerns of alleged or possible harassment or discrimination seriously no matter
how minor or who is involved.
• Ensure that harassment or inappropriate sexually oriented conduct is immediately reported to HR so that
a prompt investigation can occur.
• Take any appropriate action to prevent retaliation or prohibited conduct from recurring during and after
any investigations or complaints.
• Managers and supervisors who knowingly allow or tolerate sexual harassment or retaliation, including the
failure to immediately report such misconduct to HR, are in violation of this policy and subject to
discipline.
COMPLAINT RESOLUTION P ROCEDURES
Individuals should report complaints of conduct believed to violate [Company Name]'s sexual harassment policy
according to the policy's complaint procedures. To initiate a formal investigation into an alleged violation of this
policy, employees may be asked to provide a written statement about the alleged misconduct to the HR director.
Complaints should be submitted as soon as possible after an incident has occurred. The HR director may assist the
complainant in completing the statement.
To ensure the prompt and thorough investigation of a sexual harassment complaint, the complainant should
provide as much of the following information as is possible:
• The name, department and position of the person or persons allegedly causing the harassment.
• A description of the incident(s), including the date(s), location(s) and the presence of any witnesses.
• The effect of the incident(s) on the complainant's ability to perform his or her job, or on other terms or
conditions of his or her employment.
• The names of other individuals who might have been subject to the same or similar harassment.
• What, if any, steps the complainant has taken to try to stop the harassment.
• Any other information the complainant believes to be relevant to the harassment complaint.
D ISCIPLINE
Employees who violate this policy are subject to appropriate discipline. If an investigation results in a finding that
this policy has been violated, the mandatory minimum discipline is a written reprimand. The discipline for very
serious or repeat violations is termination of employment. Persons who violate this policy may also be subject to
civil damages or criminal penalties.
CONFIDENTIALITY
All inquiries, complaints and investigations are treated confidentially. Information is revealed strictly on a need-to-
know basis. Information contained in a formal complaint is kept as confidential as possible. However, the identity
of the complainant is usually revealed to the respondent and witnesses. The HR director takes adequate steps to
ensure that the complainant is protected from retaliation during the period of the investigation. All information
pertaining to a sexual harassment complaint or investigation is maintained by the HR director in secure files. The
HR director can answer any questions relating to the procedures for handling information related to sexual
harassment complaints and investigations to complainants and respondents.
O THER AVAILABLE P ROCEDURES
The remedies under this policy do not preempt or supersede any legal procedures or remedies otherwise available
to a victim of sexual harassment under local, state or federal law.

Commission (www.eeoc.gov), and the Society of Human Resource Management (www.shrm.org).

purposes only. Legal advice should always be taken in adopting or implementing a
Grievance Procedure).
SAMPLE GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
THE PURPOSE AND AIM OF THE GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
An employee may have a complaint in relation to work related matters. Such a grievance or
complaint may concern for example matters relating to an employee’s terms and conditions
of employment, working environment or working relationships. In the interests of fairness
and justice and to ensure the proper conduct of services specified procedures to deal with
matters of grievance are necessary and are set out as follows:-
GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
An employee’s grievance may be dealt with either informally or formally. It is for the
employee to decide whether he/she wishes to raise the grievance informally or formally.
INFORMAL PROCEDURE
It is may be possible to resolve a grievance informally. An employee may (before invoking
the formal grievance procedure) raise his/her grievance informally with the Managing Partner
Dr. “X”. If a grievance is raised informally it should be dealt with as soon as reasonably
possible. Discussions between the employee and the Managing Partner are part of this
informal procedure. Mediation and other forms of informal dispute resolution if appropriate
may be used as part of the informal procedure.
If an employee is not satisfied with the outcome of the informal procedure he/she may raise
the grievance formally under the formal grievance procedure.
If an employee feels that it is not appropriate in the circumstances to raise the grievance
informally then he/she has the right to make a complaint under the formal grievance
procedure without first having recourse to the informal procedure.
FORMAL PROCEDURE
If an employee wishes to have his/her grievance dealt with formally then the employee must
put his/her grievance in writing and this written grievance should be provided to the
Managing Partner Dr. “X”. When a grievance is raised formally it will be decided on a case
by case basis by the Managing Partner as to whether the Managing Partner or by a person
nominated by the Managing Partner shall deal with the grievance. The Managing Partner at
his/her sole discretion reserves the right in certain cases to appoint an external person to deal
with the grievance raised. The person dealing with the grievance is described as “the
designated person”. The employer reserves the right to in each case to adapt the grievance
procedure to each case. The general principles set out herein will apply to a grievance
procedure.
The general formal procedure is:
1. The grievance is set out in writing and sent to the Managing Partner.
2. The grievance shall be investigated by the designated person. The designated person
shall meet with the complainant, the alleged perpetrator (if any) and any relevant
witness on a confidential basis with a view the establishing the facts. The complainant
and alleged perpetrator (if any) may be accompanied by a fellow employee or other
representative including a trade union representative or lawyer at the employee’s own
expense.
3. Both parties (if there are two parties) shall be given a copy of all documents furnished
to the investigator and for the avoidance of all doubt that includes a copy of any
statements and any notes of meetings with the designated person.
4. The complainant and the alleged perpetrator (if any) shall be informed in writing of
the findings of the investigation into the grievance raised.
5. If the findings of the investigation are that the grievance is not well founded then the
complainant and the alleged perpetrator (if any) shall be provided with a statement in
writing setting on the findings and the reasons for the findings.
6. If the findings of the investigation is that the grievance is well founded then the
complainant and the alleged perpetrator (if any) shall be provided with a statement in
writing and setting out the findings and the reasons for the findings.
7. The complainant and the alleged perpetrator (if any) shall be given an opportunity to
comment on the findings of the investigation before any action is decided upon by the
Practice.
8. If it is found that the grievance is well founded the alleged perpetrator (if any) shall be
given a formal interview to determine the appropriate course of action for example
counselling or monitoring. Alternatively, it may be decided to initiate the disciplinary
procedure.
9. If it is found that the grievance is well founded then the complainant shall be provided
in writing with a record of the action decided upon by the Practice.
In the event of the aforementioned procedure not resolving matters to the satisfaction of the
complainant then the employee may refer the matter to an appropriate third party such as:
• Rights Commissioner
• Labour Court
• Equality Tribunal
The above procedure shall be used in the event of any complaint of bullying, harassment or
sexual harassment.
Any victimisation or retaliation or any kind against an employee who raises a grievance or a
witness or any other person will be treated very seriously and may result in disciplinary
action.
Nothing in this policy is designed to prevent an employee from exercising his or her statutory
entitlements.

foregoing, Ms. McDonald acknowledges that this Agreement, as a material contract, will be filed as an exhibit to
Stage’s next periodic report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Ms. McDonald.
6. Texas Contract. The Parties agree that this Agreement constitutes a contract to be governed by

payroll practices,

(d) A maximum aggregate of $15,000 for outplacement services for a period of twelve (12) months
from the Effective Date, which shall be paid directly to the entity providing outplacement services

entity.
10. Arbitration. Should any dispute arise relating to the meaning, interpretation, or application of
this Agreement, the dispute shall be settled in Harris County, Texas, in accordance with the employment dispute
arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association, and each party shall bear their own costs and attorney’s

11. Return of Property. Ms. McDonald shall deliver to Stage at 10201 Main Street, Houston, Texas
77025, Attention: Chief Executive Officer, on or before the Effective Date, any and all property of Stage, including
but not limited to keys, computers, credit cards, company car, documents (including Confidential Information as
defined herein) and/or any other company property in Ms. McDonald’s possession or control.
12. Attorney Fees. The Parties agree that all attorney fees, costs and income tax liability, if any,
related to this Agreement, are to be paid by the respective party.
13. No Disparagement. Ms. McDonald and Stage agree not to engage in any disruptive or
disparaging activities, directly and/or indirectly, concerning each other. This includes, but is not limited to,
disparaging comments, correspondence or conversations with any and all persons; provided, however, this clause
shall not prevent either party from testifying truthfully if compelled to do so by subpoena, court order, or other legal
process, after providing written notice to the other party.
14. Confidential Information. Ms. McDonald acknowledges that the information, observations and
data obtained by her while employed by Stage concerning the business affairs of Stage (“Confidential Information”)
are the property of Stage. Ms. McDonald shall not disclose to any unauthorized person, or use for Ms. McDonald’s
own purposes, any Confidential Information without the prior written consent of Stage’s Board of Directors, unless
and to the extent that the aforementioned matters become generally known to, and available for use by, the public
other than as a result of Ms. McDonald’s acts or omissions. Ms. McDonald shall deliver to Stage at 10201 Main
Street, Houston, Texas 77025, Attention: Chief Executive Officer, on the Effective Date, or at any other time Stage
may request, all memoranda, notes, plans, records, reports, computer tapes, printouts and software and other
documents and data (including any and all copies thereof) relating to or containing any portion of the Confidential
Information, or relating to the business of Stage which she may then possess or have under her control.
15. Non-Compete. Ms. McDonald agrees that, for a period of one year from the Effective Date, she
will not directly or indirectly either for herself or for any other person or entity (whether as an officer, director,
- 2 -
employee, owner, stockholder, consultant, agent, advisor, general partner, limited partner or otherwise), individually
or as part of a group, own, operate, manage, control, participate in, consult with, render services for, or in any
manner engage in any business competing with any part of the business presently engaged in by Stage within any
geographical area in which Stage engages or has proposed to engage in such business (or solicit any person to
engage in any of the foregoing activities). For purposes of the foregoing, a business shall be deemed to be
competing with the business of Stage if such business (a) operates apparel stores in small markets (i.e., with
populations of less than 50,000), and (b) operates a significant number of its apparel stores (25% or more of its total
apparel stores) in 10,000-30,000 square foot formats, and (c) has sales in excess of $10 million per annum, and (d)
operates an apparel store within 25 miles of a store operated by Stage. Nothing herein shall prohibit Ms. McDonald
from being a passive owner of not more than five (5%), in the aggregate, of the outstanding stock of any class of
securities of a corporation which is publicly traded and which competes in the business of Stage so long as
Ms. McDonald has no direct or indirect participation in the management or directorship of such corporation.
Ms. McDonald acknowledges that the foregoing restriction is reasonable in all respects and that no less restrictive
provision in terms of duration prohibited activities or geographic area adequately protects Stage’s assets and other
legitimate business interests.
16. Non-Solicitation. Ms. McDonald agrees that, for a period of one year from the Effective Date,
she shall not directly or indirectly, on her own behalf or for any other person or entity, induce or attempt to induce
any employee of Stage to leave the employ of Stage, hire any person who is an employee of Stage as of or
immediately prior to the time of such hiring, or induce or attempt to induce any manufacturers’ representative,
customer, supplier, licensee, agent or any other person or entity having a business relationship with Stage to cease
doing business with or reduce the volume of its business with Stage.
17. Damages. Because of the difficulty of measuring economic losses to Stage as a result of any
breach of this Agreement by Ms. McDonald, and because of the immediate and irreparable damage that could be
caused to Stage by such a breach for which it would have no other remedy, Ms. McDonald agrees that Stage may
enforce the provisions of this Agreement by injunctions and restraining orders against Ms. McDonald for such a
breach, in addition to any other available relief at law or equity. Also, should Ms. McDonald breach this
Agreement, any amounts paid by Stage to Ms. McDonald under Section 9 before the breach occurred must be
refunded to Stage by Ms. McDonald within thirty (30) days of the breach. In any action to enforce this Agreement,
the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and a reasonable attorney’s fee.
18. Mutual Release. As a material inducement to enter into this Agreement, Ms. McDonald hereby
unconditionally releases and forever discharges Stage and each of its owners, predecessors, successors, assigns,
agents, directors, officers, employees, representatives, attorneys, accountants, divisions, subsidiaries, affiliates, and
all persons acting by, through, under or in concert with any of them for any and all charges, complaints, claims,
liabilities, obligations, promises, agreement, controversies, damages, actions, causes of action, suits, rights,
demands, cost, losses, debts and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and costs actually incurred) of any nature
whatsoever, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, including but not limited to rights under Title VII of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, the Age Discrimination and Employment Act of 1967 (“ADEA”) and other
federal, state or local laws prohibiting discrimination, breach of contract or public policy, wrongful or retaliatory
discharge, defamation, personal or business injury claims growing out of any legal restrictions on Stage’s right to
terminate its employees that Ms. McDonald now has, or holds or claims to have owned or held or which
Ms. McDonald would at any time heretofore have had, owned or held against Stage or any Stage related entity.
Ms. McDonald and Stage hereby expressly waive the benefit of any statute or rule of law which, if applied to this
Agreement, would otherwise exclude from its binding effect any claims not now known by Ms. McDonald or Stage
to exist.
To comply with the Older Worker’s Benefit Protection Act of 1990 (the “Act”), Stage has advised
Ms. McDonald of the legal requirements of this Act and fully incorporates the legal requirements of the Act by
reference into this Agreement as follows:
a. This Agreement is written in layman’s terms, and Ms. McDonald represents that she understands
and comprehends its terms;
- 3 -
b. Ms. McDonald has been advised of her rights to consult an attorney to review this Agreement and
have the benefit of an attorney through the settlement process;
c. Ms. McDonald does not waive any rights or claims that may arise after the date this Agreement is
executed;
d. Ms. McDonald affirms that she is receiving consideration beyond anything of value to which she
is already entitled; and
e. Ms. McDonald has been given a reasonable period of time to consider this Agreement.
19. Consideration Period, Limited Revocation And Effective Date. The parties agree that
Ms. McDonald was provided at least twenty-one (21) calendar days during which to consider whether to sign this
Severance Agreement-Release of All Claims. The signed Agreement must be delivered to Stage Stores, Inc., 10201
Main Street, Houston, Texas 77025, Attention: Chief Executive Officer, no later than 5:00 p.m. C.S.T., on
August 23, 2004. In any event, Ms. McDonald will have seven (7) calendar days from the date she signs and
delivers a copy of the Agreement to Stage Stores, Inc., 10201 Main Street, Houston, Texas 77025, Attention: Chief
Executive Officer, during which Ms. McDonald may revoke the Agreement by delivering a signed and dated notice
of revocation to Stage Stores, Inc., 10201 Main Street, Houston, Texas 77025, Attention: Chief Executive Officer.
This Agreement becomes effective and enforceable when the seven (7) day revocation period has expired if
Ms. McDonald has not delivered a written revocation to Stage Stores, Inc., 10201 Main Street, Houston, Texas
77025, Attention: Chief Executive Officer, before that time.
20. Payment Of Other Compensation. Ms. McDonald acknowledges that except as set forth in
Section 9, all compensation normally due her at the time of her termination will be paid by Stage within 14 calendar
days from the date of her termination. Except as set forth in Section 9, any other benefits to which Ms. McDonald
may be entitled shall be distributed in accordance with the terms of the individual plan documents.
21. Stock Options. The Parties acknowledge that pursuant to the terms and conditions of a Stock
Option Agreement dated August 24, 2001, Ms. McDonald was issued options for 150,000 shares of the Company’s
common stock in three groupings with per share exercise prices of $13.75, $15.00 and $16.25, respectively (the
“Options”). The Parties also acknowledge that the right to exercise the Options vests over four years from
August 24, 2001, with 25% of each grouping vesting at the end of each of the first four years following the date of
grant, and expire sixty (60) days after the Effective Date.
(a) Ms. McDonald agrees and acknowledges that as of the Effective Date the following Options will
have vested, are exercisable, and will remain exercisable until November 4, 2004, at which time
they shall expire:
12,500 Options @ $13.75/share
12,500 Options @ $15.00/share
12,500 Options @ $16.25/share
(b) Ms. McDonald agrees and acknowledges that as of the Effective Date, the following options have
not become vested and shall be forfeited as of the Effective Date:
12,500 Options @ $13.75/share
12,500 Options @ $15.00/share
12,500 Options @ $16.25/share
- 4 -
22. Exchange Act Compliance. Ms. McDonald acknowledges (a) that as an officer of Stage she has
received a copy of the Company’s Insider Trading and Reporting Policy (as of January 21, 2004) (the “Policy”) and
that she is a Section 16(a) Reporting Person as identified on Exhibit A to the Policy, (b) that pursuant to
Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Section 16(b)”), directors, officers and
principal shareholders must disgorge profits received in the event they purchase and sell, or sell and purchase,
Stage’s common stock or other equity securities within a six month period (any transaction executed within six
months of an opposite transaction) (“short-swing profits”), (c) that the exercise of a stock option and the sale of the
stock acquired does not trigger liability for short-swing profits; however, the sale of the stock acquired from the
exercise of a stock option by a former officer or director of Stage will be matched against all purchases of Stage
stock within six months prior to the date of sale of the stock acquired from exercise of the stock option and is
therefore reportable under Section 16(a) on Form 4; and Section 16(b) remains applicable to former officers and
directors for a period of six months after they cease to be in those positions, (d) it is becoming common practice for
shareholders of public companies and their counsel to monitor transactions reported to the SEC by directors, officers
and principal shareholders of those public companies in an effort to cause the disgorgement of profits made by those
persons, (e) in addition to the disgorgement of profits, those shareholders also seek the reimbursement of their
attorneys fees related to their investigation of Section 16(b) violations even if a lawsuit is not filed to recover the
profits, and (f) directors and officers may also be subject to SEC or court imposed civil penalties of up to $100,000.
Therefore, Ms. McDonald acknowledges and agrees as follows:
• Transactions by her after the Effective Date that occur within six months of an opposite transaction that
occurred before the Effective Date must be reported by her on a Form 4 report, the preparation and
electronic filing with the SEC of which she agrees to be solely responsible,
• Transactions by her after the Effective Date that do not occur within six months of an opposite transaction
that occurred before the Effective Date do not have to be reported on a Form 4 report,
• She need not file a Form 4 report solely to indicate her resignation, and
• She will indemnify Stage against, and immediately reimburse Stage for, any losses, including attorney’s
fees, Stage may incur as a result of any violation by her of Section 16(b).
23. Terms of This Agreement are Severable. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, the
invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of this Agreement which can be given effect without the
invalid provision or applications; and to this end the provisions of this Agreement are declared to be severable.
24. Entire Agreement. The Parties agree that this Agreement contains the entire agreement between
them and supersedes all prior and/or contemporaneous written or oral agreements between them. The Parties also
agree and acknowledge that no other promises or agreements have been offered before this Agreement (other than
what is described herein) and that no other promise or agreement between the Parties will be binding unless it is in
writing and signed by the Parties.
25. MS. MCDONALD ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SHE HAS CAREFULLY READ THIS
AGREEMENT, KNOWS AND UNDERSTANDS ITS CONTENT AND MEANING, AND HAS NOT BEEN
COERCED OR THREATENED INTO SIGNING IT. MS. MCDONALD IS HEREBY ADVISED TO CONSULT
WITH AN ATTORNEY OF MS. MCDONALD’S CHOOSING REGARDING THE EFFECT OF THIS
AGREEMENT PRIOR TO SIGNING IT.

Drafting Notes
Drafting Note to Third Paragraph
This whereas clause is silent regarding any fault or breach of performance by the parties. Use the Alternate Clause
to Third Paragraph to clearly express that neither party is at fault nor has either party breached its performance
obligations under the contract. For more information regarding whereas clauses, see Term, Recitals, and
Definitions — Drafting Recitals.
Drafting Note to Section 1
The Release Agreement should include a provision that sets forth the effective date for termination of the subject
contract, which might be immediately upon execution of the release agreement, or at a future agreed upon date.
Counsel should review the contract being terminated and confer with the client and ascertain whether there are any
outstanding obligations that need to be completed or other matters that should be resolved prior to the termination
of the Contract and include a suitable termination date. The terminated agreement may contain specific terms
regarding the parties’ respective rights and obligations upon termination, in which case the optional language in this
clause can be used to confirm that such terms will be used with respect to the termination. If any termination
provisions in the contract will be waived or modified, the Release Agreement should clearly identify such terms and
specify whether the Parties agree to waive performance of such obligations or how such provisions are being
modified. For more information regarding termination, see Termination and Cancellation Rights and Termination
Agreement.
Drafting Note to Section 2
Any consideration to be provided by any of the Parties should be fully set forth in the agreement. In this example,
Party B will make a final payment to Party A for the services rendered under the Contract; counsel will want to
ensure that the Release Agreement will fully compensate the client for all amounts, including reimbursable
expenses, that are due and owing from the other Party or the amount the Parties have agreed upon to resolve any
claims and terminate the Contract. Termination should not affect the Parties’ obligations for any transactions that
occur between them prior to the effective date of termination, such as in the case of a sales contract where there
will be additional sales prior to termination; the terms of sale and the buyer’s payment obligations should continue
as provided for in the underlying contract. For certain agreements there may be no additional consideration paid, in
which case the clause can be modified to reflect that no further amounts are owed (see Alternate Clause to Section
2).
Drafting Note to Section 3
A critical term in any termination and release agreement will be the release language. Counsel needs to carefully
draft (or review) the terms relating to the claims and matters being released by the parties and ensure that the
language properly memorializes the client’s understanding as to its agreement. The parties will usually want the
release language to be broad and cover any existing or future claims, whether or not such claims are known or
unknown, relating to the Contract. Additionally, the release should cover all applicable entities and personnel of the
parties. Counsel will need to have a clear understanding on the underlying rights and obligations provided for in the
Contract and ensure that the client fully comprehends the legal effect that entering into the Release Agreement will
have on its rights. Alternate Clause to Section 3 provides more abbreviated release terms.
Drafting Note to Section 4
If there are any provisions in the Contract being terminated that will survive the termination, the Release Agreement
should clearly identify such provisions. In such cases, it may be prudent to specifically identify all of the clauses in
the Contract that will survive termination. For example, the terminated agreement may have confidentiality
provisions that are intended to survive termination. Similarly, if any provision in the Contract will be modified or
waived pursuant to the termination, such terms should also be spelled out in the Release Agreement. Counsel
should thoroughly review the Contract and ensure that no terms or rights that are supposed to survive are
inadvertently terminated. If there will be any additional transactions taking place before the Termination Date (such
Release Agreement
as the performance of additional services), the Agreement should make clear that the termination will not have a
negative affect or impact upon such transactions. For more information regarding termination, see Termination and
Cancellation Rights and Termination Agreement.
Drafting Note to Section 5
Unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties, each Party should be responsible for its costs and expenses incurred in
entering into the Release Agreement. If the termination agreement will provide for the payment of any costs or
expenses, including attorneys’ fees or other costs incurred by a Party with respect to the Contract or the Release
Agreement, such obligations should be clearly spelled out. However, the Parties may want to also include a
provision that awards attorneys’ fees and costs to the prevailing Party should there be a dispute regarding
performance or enforcement of the Release Agreement (see Section 10).
Drafting Note to Section 6
Each party will want assurances that the other has not assigned or delegated any of its rights under the terminated
contract, as the termination and release may not be effective as to a party’s assignee. The agreement should
therefore include a representation that the Contract has not been assigned. The clause contains additional
representations that the Agreement is the authorized act of each party and that the persons signing the release are
authorized to do so. For more information regarding representations, see Representations and Warranties Drafting
and Commercial Agreement Representations, Warranties, Covenants, Rights, and Conditions.
Drafting Note to Section 7
The Parties will not want their entering into the Release Agreement to be deemed an admission of liability or
wrongdoing of any kind. This clause makes clear that the agreement shall not be construed as an admission of
liability or wrongdoing by either of the Parties.
Drafting Note to Section 9
This provision provides the governing law that will be used to interpret the terms of the Agreement. The clause also
contains an exclusive venue provision where any dispute between the Parties arising out of the Agreement must be
litigated. Counsel for the drafting Party should select a convenient state and county for the venue. The provision
further contains a jury waiver clause; counsel should confirm that such a waiver is desired by the client. For more
information regarding governing law, see Commercial Contract Drafting and Review — Governing Law. For more
information regarding venue, see Choice of Law and Choice of Forum Clauses
Drafting Note to Section 10
The inclusion of a provision awarding fees to the prevailing party in any proceeding to enforce the Release
Agreement can provide a significant incentive for timely performance of the Parties’ obligations. In the event a party
will be receiving a payment under the agreement and is required to being an action to enforce the other party’s
payment obligations, it will want to recoup the fees and costs it incurs in enforcing the agreement. For more
information regarding attorneys’ fees, see Commercial Contract Drafting and Review — Attorneys’ Fees.
Drafting Note to Section 12
This is standard language in most commercial agreements and provides that should a court find a particular clause
in the agreement invalid, all other terms of the Agreement will remain in full force and effect. For more information
regarding severability, see Commercial Contract Drafting and Review — Attorneys’ Fees.

Alternate & Optional Clauses
Alternate Clause to Third Paragraph: WHEREAS, the Parties, each have found no fault or breach with respect to
the other's performance under the Contract, but have mutually decided to terminate the Contract and to resolve any
and all claims and potential claims that could have been asserted arising out of or relating to the Contract and the
Parties’ performance thereunder.
Drafting Note to Alternate Clause to Third Paragraph
This clause clearly expresses (as opposed to remaining silent) that neither party is at fault or has breached such
party’s performance obligations under contract. For more information regarding whereas clauses, see Term,
Recitals, and Definitions — Drafting Recitals.
Alternate Clause to Section 2: Each party acknowledges and agrees that it has already received all payments and
amounts owed from the other Party under the Contract and that no additional consideration of any kind is due from
the other Party with respect to the Contract.
Drafting Note to Alternate Clause to Section 2
Use this clause when no additional consideration will be paid or received by the parties under the contract.
Alternate Clause to Section 3: Party A and Party B hereby mutually release each other and each of their
respective successors and assigns from and against any and all claims, demands, proceedings, actions, costs, and
damages whatsoever that either of them now has or may hereafter have against the other party hereto, by reason
of or in connection with the Contract.

Introduction
Indian constitution encapsulates social safeguard measures for all citizens of India in Article 15
and Article 16.
Article 15 mandates prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or
place of birth.
Article 16 mandates equal opportunity in matters of public employment. Article 16(2) further
states that no citizen shall on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth,
residence or any of them, be ineligible for, or discriminated against in respect of, any
employment or office under the State.
The United Nations Convention on Elimination of Discrimination against Women, 1979, United
Nations International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination
(1965), the Universal Declaration of Human Rights International Covenant on Economic, Social
and Cultural Rights (1966), strongly advocate against discrimination in their respective domains.

all forms of discrimination. Equal opportunity means that all staff experience fairness,
impartiality and equal access to all career initiatives in the DEF.

This EEO and Anti-Discrimination Policy is consistent with the DEF’s pursuit of excellence. This
policy is underpinned by a set of values and key guiding principles in the building of a
community of all employees.

Once a complaint has been filed:
Investigation
Once a complaint has been filed an investigation will be undertaken immediately. In instances
where there is an alleged respondent, the respondent will be notified immediately. The
complainant and the respondent will both be interviewed along with any individuals who may
be able to provide relevant information.
Where the alleged discrimination is an organizational practice or procedure, that practice or
procedure will be investigated immediately. Where the investigation finds systemic
discrimination within the organization, that practice or procedure will be changed promptly.
Mediation
DEF supports resolving matters through mediation provided that it is consistent with
organizational duties, obligations and needs. Mediation can only be undertaken voluntarily. If
both parties agree to participate, matters may be resolved through mediation in the following
© Digital Empowerment Foundation Page 7
circumstances. Once the matter has been investigated and DEF has determined the facts of the
case, DEF may use mediation to develop appropriate solutions to the complaint; and, in rare
instances, where the incident is an isolated event and the parties do not dispute the facts, DEF
will act diligently to ensure that matters are dealt with in a manner that ensures the safety and
protection of everyone within the organization.
Timelines
DEF will investigate all complaints immediately and will work towards the prompt resolution
and prevention of discriminatory acts and practices. The first round of investigation and
conclusion shall be arrived at within 10 working days from the date of filing of the complaint.
Fairness
All complaints will be investigated in the same manner with the aim of promoting, fairness and
equality.
Confidentiality and the Right to Privacy
DEF will preserve the confidentiality of all individuals involved in a discrimination complaint.
The preservation of confidentiality may be affected by the employer’s duty to prevent
discrimination in/at DEF and by the alleged respondent’s right to know the nature of the
complaint being made against them and who has made it so that they can respond.
If the investigation fails to find evidence to support the complaint, no documentation
concerning the complaint will be placed on the file of the respondent. DEF will retain all
documentation for 12 months for informational purposes in the event that there is an internal
appeal or a complaint filed with an outside agency.
Outcomes and Remedies
DEF will act swiftly to ensure that the discriminatory practice is stopped as soon as possible and
may remedy the situation in a number of ways. Where the investigation determines that
discrimination has occurred or the matter has been successfully mediated, outcomes may
© Digital Empowerment Foundation Page 8
include moving the respondent to another department, changing the respondent’s job duties,
or a letter of apology. Actions taken to remedy a discriminatory situation should not have a
negative effect on the complainant. The main concerns of the employer will be to ensure that
the discrimination ends and to restore workplace harmony.
Appeal Process
Within 10 days from the result of first round of investigation, either the complainant or the
respondent may make a written request that an investigation be reviewed stating which aspect
of the investigation is inadequate. The request must be submitted to Mr. Osama Manzar, who
will determine if the investigation is to be re-opened in order to address the concerns raised.
In case the appeal is taken up, then the investigation shall be completed within 15 working days
by the same committee with the inclusion of an independent member. The result of the appeal
shall be binding on the complainant for all purposes.

Executive Summary
Background Information
Human Resources Objectives and Data
The Human Resources Department consists of 33.5 full time employees and is located at the
John Stanford Center of Education Excellence. Human Resources’ primary function is to support
the district in its academic achievement by recruiting and retaining high quality, diverse staff. They
also offer resources and support to all District staff for the employment life cycle including
recruitment, on boarding, employee performance and evaluation, labor relations, and retirement.
As of July 15, 2012, the District spent approximately $463,127,000 in salary and benefits for
2011- 2012 school year.
Human Resources Management and Changes in Leadership
The Human Resources Department has endured 12 different changes to the top leadership
position during the last 14 years. This alarming rate of turnover in a key leadership position
increases the risk that responsibilities and expectations are not clearly understood or aligned with
District initiatives. It also increases the risk that institutional knowledge has left the District with
these previous employees, and that current staff are unaware of key internal control
requirements. Currently, the Human Resources Department is in the process of reorganization.
Three new positions have been created, including a Director of Operations/Recruitment, a
Director of Labor/Employee Relations, and a Human Resources Operations Case Manager.
There is also anticipation that some functions will be reconfigured and moved out of the core
human resources functionality.
Human Resources Structure and Satellite Locations
In addition to the main Human Resources Department, there are two satellite locations
(Operations and Child Nutrition Services) that perform human resource functions. These satellite
locations have higher turnover rates compared to other District departments, and have an
increased need for a quick turnaround time when hiring new staff. Due to this urgency, Facilities
Operations and Child Nutrition Services have parallel human resource processes for recruitment,
on boarding, and employee performance and evaluations. Labor relations and retirement are
central functions under the core Human Resources and Payroll Departments.
Current Human Resources Initiatives
The Human Resource Department is in the process of identifying its short-term improvements
and its long-term improvements. Currently short term improvements include ongoing efforts of
human resources staff to improve and document all processes in order to provide better customer
service. Initiatives undertaken for the short term are optimization of screening capabilities of
NeoGov.com (District’s online application system), improving the hourly and administrative hiring
process, and implementing an evaluation process that provides support to school administrators.
The long-range goals include the implementation of the case manager model and of an
automation process for “on-boarding” and principal access to data. (This paragraph is based on the
information provided by Human Resources).

Human Resources
September 1, 2010 – June 30, 2012
Human Resources Compliance Requirements
Human Resources related policies can be found under School Board Policies - Series 5000.
These policies are applicable not just to the central Human Resources Department, but are
applicable to the Facilities Operations and Child Nutrition Services functions as well. Our audit
procedures included all functions related to human resources, including the centralized Human
Resources Department and the satellite locations.
Human Resources is subject to numerous compliance requirements due to key Federal and State
employment legislations. The compliance requirements should be continuously monitored, and
include:
• Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA)
• Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
• Civil Rights Act (Title VII)
• Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA)
• Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)
• Equal Pay Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act and Fair Credit and Accurate Credit Transactions
Act of 2003
• Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)
• Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA)
• Immigration Reform Control ACT (IRCA)
• Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA)
• Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA)
• Rehabilitation Act
• Uniformed Services Employment and Re-employment Rights Act (USERRA)
• RCW 28A and WAC 392
• Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
Compliance with these requirements is legally essential to prevent unnecessary fines and
litigation.
Roles and Responsibilities
This audit was completed as part of the Annual Risk Assessment and Audit Plan approved by the
Audit and Finance Committee on October 11, 2011. District management has the primary
responsibility to establish, implement, and monitor internal controls. Internal Audit’s function is to
assess and test those controls in order to provide reasonable assurance that the controls are
adequate and operating effectively. We conducted the audit using due professional care, and we
believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions.
3 of 10
Internal Audit Report
Human Resources
September 1, 2010 – June 30, 2012
Audit Objectives
To evaluate compliance and internal controls in the following areas:
• HR Organization
To determine whether there are defined roles, responsibilities, operating procedures, and
communication protocols that contribute to an efficient and effective Human Resources
function.
• Employment Planning
To review the employee hiring process and determine if it is in compliance with Equal
Employment Opportunity requirements, including the hiring of hourly employees and
employees hired by the satellite locations.
• Employee Evaluations
To determine whether employee appraisals are completed in a timely manner to maintain
the District’s quality of service and adhere to State compliance requirements.
• Payroll Administration
To assess the security of sensitive employee payroll data within Human Resources,
Operations, and Child Nutrition Services.
• Personnel Files
To test employee personnel files and ensure that they are secure and updated
appropriately.
Scope of the Audit
September 1, 2010 through June 30, 2012
Audit Approach and Methodology
To achieve the audit objectives, we performed the following procedures:
• Planned the audit in cooperation with Human Resources, Facilities Operations’ human
resources function, Child Nutrition Services’ human resources function, the Department of
Technology Services, and Legal to ensure that we had a strong understanding of the
District’s compliance requirements.
• Interviewed Human Resources staff knowledgeable of each objective area.
• Analyzed available data to corroborate the information obtained.
• Reviewed the District’s internal compliance requirements, researched OSPI requirements,
evaluated State and Federal requirements related to Human Resources, and compared
the results with the District’s current policies and procedures.
4 of 10
Internal Audit Report
Human Resources
September 1, 2010 – June 30, 2012
• Conducted a detailed risk assessment, including an analysis of inherent and residual risks
to determine our areas of focus. Each function within Human Resources was evaluated to
determine which areas present the greatest risk to the District. Those areas deemed to be
the most risky were included in our final audit plan, which led us to our audit objectives.
Those areas not included in the objectives for this engagement will be re-evaluated during
future audits of this area.
• Performed detailed tests of the objective areas to support our conclusions.
Conclusion
We commend the Human Resources Department for progressively working towards positive
change and striving to establish a structured function. During the course of our audit we noted
many initiatives and improvements being implemented within Human Resources; however, we
also noted specific issues with each of the audit objectives. Our concerns are detailed in the
Findings and Recommendations section of this report, and are intended to improve internal
controls, compliance, and accountability.
We made Human Resources leadership and staff aware of our findings during the course of the
audit, and they have already made efforts towards improvement. We extend our appreciation to
the staff within the Human Resources Department, and the satellite locations for their assistance
and cooperation during the course of the audit.

Human Resources
September 1, 2010 – June 30, 2012
Findings and Recommendations
1) Communications, Policies, and Procedures
We noted that the organizational design of Human Resources has resulted in poor
communication across the organization. As a result, managers and employees are often unsure
of their roles and responsibilities, and procedures are frequently reinvented by the replacing
employee. This situation reduces accountability, and increases the risk of noncompliance with
State and Federal requirements.
There are insufficient operating procedures to ensure clear processes throughout the human
resources function. Specifically, we noted that:
• There is no handbook to guide Human Resources employees on the procedures they are
expected to follow.
• There is no employee handbook to guide all District employees on important policies and
procedures, such as sexual harassment, discrimination, ethics, and internet usage.
• There is no clear channel of communication within Human Resources to share important
information such as changes to compliance requirements, policies and procedures, and
industry best practices.
• There is a lack of accountability in monitoring legislative updates and compliance
requirements specific to the human resources function.
• Training is not provided to employees in the satellite locations on the proper procedures
and compliance requirements related to the human resources functions they are
performing.
• There are no procedures relating to the hiring of site-based hourly employees, resulting in
inefficiencies in the Human Resources Department and its satellite functions.
Recommendation
We recommend that Human Resources management:
• Establish a framework of policies and procedures for supporting the internal processes.
(i.e. Human Resources handbook, hourly hiring procedures, etc)
• Create a central repository of employee responsibility policies, such as sexual
harassment, discrimination, ethics, and internet usage.
• Develop a clear channel of communication so that future productivity strains can be
avoided.
• Designate a staff member to track and monitor all Human Resources related compliance
requirements, who will be responsible for ensuring that any changes to the compliance
requirements or industry best practices are communicated to the remaining staff.
• Brainstorm and exchange ideas with the satellite functions during the early stages of
writing procedures, so that best practices of each process can be shared and adopted in
the organization as a whole.
• Train satellite locations to be aware of human resources compliance requirements, or
explore having one centralized human resources function.

Human Resources
September 1, 2010 – June 30, 2012
Management Response
The human resources department is in agreement that there have been insufficient policies and
procedures to ensure clear processes are in place throughout the human resources function.
The following outlines the human resource department response:
1. HR will develop a handbook, which will include policies and procedures to support
effective internal process.
2. HR will develop policies and procedures that address areas of employee responsibility
such as sexual harassment, discrimination, ethics, and internet usage.
3. HR will develop and implement a clear channel of communication in order to improve
industry best practices, understand compliance requirements, and increase the timely
response to human resource functions.
4. HR will designate a staff member who will track compliance requirements and monitor
legislative updates. Additionally, a system to share important updates will be
implemented in the department.
5. HR will develop and implement a system to ensure satellite locations are informed and
involved in the implementation of best practices regarding procedures and compliance
requirements.
6. HR will develop procedures for the hiring of site-based hourly employees.

Human Resources
September 1, 2010 – June 30, 2012
2) Employee Evaluations
The Human Resources Department did not have an effective mechanism to consolidate and track
whether evaluations were completed and submitted on time. The scope of our evaluation testing
was the 2010-2011 academic year. Our procedures revealed that 24% of the employees tested
did not have an evaluation on file. The evaluations that were on file did not contain a date-
received stamp or other form of evidence to substantiate that they were submitted to Human
Resources by their prescribed due date.
The Revised Code of Washington (RCW 28A.150.230) requires that all staff be evaluated on their
performance on an annual basis. Annual evaluations are also required by School Board Policy
5240, which states, “The proper evaluation of staff is an integral part in improving student
achievement and the efficiency of district operations.”
Recommendation
We recommend that management take corrective action to ensure that an annual evaluation is
performed on each employee and submitted to Human Resources by the prescribed deadline.
Management Response
The human resources department is in agreement that there have been ineffective mechanisms
in place to consolidate and track evaluations in order to ensure they are completed and on time.
The following outlines the human resource department response:
1. HR will develop and implement a system to ensure each employee is evaluated within
the prescribed deadline.
2. HR will review the evaluation process to ensure school and department administrators
are aware of their responsibility to evaluate each employee.
Audit and Finance Committee Comments
During the Audit and Finance Committee meeting on September 11, 2012, the Committee
requested that internal audit also evaluate the quality of the completed evaluations. Specifically,
do the evaluations contain quality assessments, or are they turned in with minimal comments to
simply be categorized as complete? As a result, the Office of Internal Audit will conduct a special
engagement to accommodate this request.

Internal Audit Report
Human Resources
September 1, 2010 – June 30, 2012
3) Employee Data and Payroll Administration
During our test work of roles and authorities in the SAP HR Module, we noted that every member
in Human Resources (including the satellite locations) and Payroll Department has access to the
Personnel Administrator role. This role not only has authority to change employees’ private
information, but it also impacts employee payroll. Specifically, the role allows changes to be made
to items such as an employee start date, pay grade, and qualifications.
We observed that the transactions associated with the Personnel Administrator role have not
changed since the system was first implemented. The degree of access to the data under the
Personnel Administrator role increases the risk of errors and abuse.
Recommendation
We recommend that management review all the transactions allowed with the Personnel
Administrator role, within the SAP HR Module, and limit access to sensitive transactions. View
only roles should be created for those employees whose job descriptions do not require them to
edit sensitive employee data.
We also recommend that management monitor changes to sensitive employee data to ensure
that all transactions are appropriate, and that no one person can individually create or alter
employee information. Segregation of roles and duties will enable the department to establish a
controlled structure that will assist the District in preventing fraud and detecting errors.
Management Response
The human resources department is in agreement, allowing access to Personnel Information to
every member of Human Resources, HR Satellite locations and the Payroll Department increases
the risk of errors and abuse.
1. HR will review transactions allowed with the Personnel Administrator role, within the
SAP HR Module.
2. HR will create limited access to sensitive transactions to those who need to edit
sensitive employee data.
9 of 10
Internal Audit Report
Human Resources
September 1, 2010 – June 30, 2012
4) Personnel Files
There are two kinds of employee files; personnel files and medical files. The personnel files
contain items such as evaluations, certifications, job application, and supporting documents to
bring the employee on board. Medical files are limited to an employee’s medical and insurance
data, and are considered highly confidential. Our audit procedures were limited to the contents of
the personnel files.
We noted that the personnel files contain personal information, such as copies of social security
cards and driver’s licenses, and that appropriate safeguards are not in place to protect
employees’ personal information. There are no policies and procedures for the file room to
safeguard and control the contents of employee’s personal information.
In addition to the concerns specific to the personnel files, we also noted that the District does not
have an entity-wide policy or procedure regarding the security of employees’ personal
information. There is potential legal, financial, and reputational risk for the District if employees’
personal information is compromised at any level.
Recommendation
We recommend that management continue its efforts to clean up and organize employee files. In
addition to ensuring compliance with Federal and State requirements regarding the contents of
employee files, special attention should be given to establishing accountability over employee
personnel files and ensuring that personal information is not compromised at any level. We also
recommend that the District create a written policy or procedure to protect employees’ private
information, including restrictions on access and storage of sensitive information.
Management Response
The human resources department is in agreement both personnel and medical files need to be in
compliance with Federal and State requirements regarding the contents of employee files.
1. HR will develop and create written policies and procedures to protect employees’
private information.
2. HR will review employee personnel and medical files access, storage and
organization.
3. HR will evaluate and create a plan that will provided adequate staffing in the file room.

a business expense(s) of the employer including attorney fees and other costs connected to the performance of H-1B, H-1B1, or E-3

(2) Working Conditions: The employer shall provide working conditions for nonimmigrants which will not adversely affect the working
conditions of workers similarly employed. The employer’s obligation regarding working conditions shall extend for the duration of the

(4) Notice: Notice of the LCA filing was provided no more than 30 days before the filing of this LCA or will be provided on the day this LCA is

copy of the notice documentation will be maintained in the employer’s public access file. A copy of this LCA will be provided to each
nonimmigrant worker employed pursuant to the LCA. The employer shall, no later than the date the worker(s) report to work at the
place(s) of employment, provide a signed copy of the certified LCA to the worker(s) working pursuant to this LCA. 20 CFR 655.734.

U.S. Department of Labor
Form ETA- 9035/9035E FOR DEPARTMENT OF LABOR USE ONLY
Case Number:_______________________ Case Status: __________________ Period of Employment: ______________ to _______________
If you marked “Yes” to questions H.a.1 (H-1B dependent) and/or H.a.2 (H-1B willful violator) and “No” to question H.a.3 (exempt H-1B
nonimmigrant workers), you MUST read Section H – Subsection 2 of the Form ETA 9035CP – General Instructions for the 9035 & 9035E
under the heading “Additional Employer Labor Condition Statements” and indicate your agreement to all three (3) additional
statements summarized below.
b. Subsection 2
A. Displacement: An H-1B dependent or willful violator employer is prohibited from displacing a U.S. worker in its own workforce within the
period beginning 90 days before and ending 90 days after the date of filing of the visa petition. 20 CFR 655.738(c);
B. Secondary Displacement: An H-1B dependent or willful violator employer is prohibited from placing an H-1B nonimmigrant worker(s)
with another/secondary employer where there are indicia of an employment relationship between the nonimmigrant worker(s) and that
other/secondary employer (thus possibly affecting the jobs of U.S. workers employed by that other employer), unless and until the
employer subject to this LCA makes the inquiries and/or receives the information set forth in 20 CFR 655.738(d)(5) concerning that
other/secondary employer’s displacement of similarly employed U.S. workers in its workforce within the period beginning 90 days before
and ending 90 days after the date of such placement. 20 CFR 655.738(d). Even if the required inquiry of the secondary employer is
made, the H-1B dependent or willful violator employer will be subject to a finding of a violation of the secondary displacement prohibition
if the secondary employer, in fact, displaces any U.S. worker(s) during the applicable time period; and
C. Recruitment and Hiring: Prior to filing this LCA or any petition or request for extension of status for nonimmigrant worker(s) supported
by this LCA, the H-1B dependent or willful violator employer must take good faith steps to recruit U.S. workers for the job(s) using
procedures that meet industry-wide standards and offer compensation that is at least as great as the required wage to be paid to the
nonimmigrant worker(s) pursuant to 20 CFR 655.731(a). The employer must offer the job(s) to any U.S. worker who applies and is
equally or better qualified for the job than the nonimmigrant worker. 20 CFR 655.739.
