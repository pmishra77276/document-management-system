TO: Members of Actuarial Organizations Governed by the Standards of Practice of the
Actuarial Standards Board and Other Persons Interested in Regulatory Filings for
Health Plan Entities
FROM: Actuarial Standards Board (ASB)
SUBJ: Actuarial Standard of Practice (ASOP) No. 8
This booklet contains the final version of the revision of ASOP No. 8, now titled Regulatory
Filings for Health Plan Entities.
Background
The ASB originally adopted ASOP No. 8, Regulatory Filings for Rates and Financial
Projections for Health Plans (Doc. No. 010), in 1989. Under the guidance of the ASB Health
Committee, the Task Force to Revise ASOP No. 8 has prepared this revision to be consistent
with the current ASOP format and to reflect current, generally accepted actuarial practices with
respect to regulatory filings for health plan entities.
Exposure Draft
The exposure draft of this ASOP was issued in September 2004 with a comment deadline of
March 31, 2005. Fourteen comment letters, showing thoughtful insight of the issues, were
received and considered in developing the final ASOP. For a summary of the substantive issues
contained in the exposure draft comment letters and the responses, please see appendix 2.
The most significant changes since the exposure draft were as follows:
1. The language on applicable law in section 1.2 was updated to be consistent with current
boilerplate language to be used in other ASOPs and removed from section 2.1.
2. The task force modified the language regarding section 3.2.2, Consistency with Business
Plans (now section 3.2.3, Use of Business Plans to Project Future Results), to address
commentators’ concerns regarding the actuary’s use of any relevant information from any
business plan(s) as part of the process of setting assumptions and methodologies used in the
filing. The task force also removed the requirement of consistency in assumptions between
the business plan and the filing.
3. The task force modified section 3.2.3, Reasonableness of Assumptions, in the exposure draft
and moved it to the last section within 3.2, Issues and Recommended Practices for Health
ASOP No. 8—December 2005
iv
Filings. The language clarifies the requirements when the actuary reviews the reasonableness
of assumptions.
4. The task force modified the language in section 3.2.6, New Plans or Benefits, to address the
issues regarding data raised by the commentators.
5. The task force modified section 3.3, Reliance on Others (now Reliance on Data or Other
Information Supplied by Others), to use language consistent with other recent ASOPs.
6. The task force changed the language in section 4.3, Deviation from Standard, to be consistent
with that used in other recent ASOPs.
The Health Committee thanks all those who commented on the exposure draft.
The ASB voted in December 2005 to adopt this standard.

ACTUARIAL STANDARD OF PRACTICE NO. 8
REGULATORY FILINGS FOR HEALTH PLAN ENTITIES
STANDARD OF PRACTICE
Section 1. Purpose, Scope, Cross References, and Effective Date
1.1 Purpose⎯This actuarial standard of practice (ASOP) provides guidance to actuaries
when performing professional services with respect to preparing or reviewing required
regulatory filings for health plan entities and health benefit plans provided by health plan
entities.
1.2 Scope⎯This standard applies to actuaries when performing professional services with
respect to preparing or reviewing health filings, as defined in section 2.3, required by and
made to state insurance departments, state health departments, the federal government,
and other regulatory bodies. Health filings require projection of future contingent events
and can be categorized into two broad categories: rate or benefit filings and financial
projection filings. Some of these filings are made on behalf of health plan entities, such
as filings made in conjunction with applications for licensure. Other filings are required
for health benefit plans provided by health plan entities, such as filings for approval of
rates. Such filings may be required for new and existing health plan entities, for new
health benefit plans, and for revisions to existing health benefit plans.
The filings covered by this standard do not include filings to certify compliance with
rating methods and other actuarial practices applicable to carriers for small employer
health benefit plans (see ASOP No. 26, Compliance with Statutory and Regulatory
Requirements for the Actuarial Certification of Small Employer Health Benefit Plans);
statements of actuarial opinion relating to statutory financial statements of health plan
entities (see ASOP No. 22, Statements of Opinion Based on Asset Adequacy Analysis by
Actuaries for Life and Health Insurers, and ASOP No. 28, Compliance with Statutory
Statement of Actuarial Opinion Requirements for Hospital, Medical, and Dental Service
or Indemnity Corporations, and for Health Maintenance Organizations); and filings that
are solely experience reports and do not require projection of future contingent events.
This standard is not meant to provide a complete set of recommended practices for the
determination of health rates, financial projection entries, or other numerical information
required to be included in health filings. It represents areas of inquiry and analysis that an
actuary should consider when preparing or reviewing a required health filing for purposes
of compliance with applicable law.
ASOP No. 8—December 2005
2
If the actuary departs from the guidance set forth in this standard in order to comply with
applicable law (statutes, regulations, and other legally binding authority), or for any other
reason the actuary deems appropriate, the actuary should refer to section 4.
1.3 Cross References⎯When this standard refers to the provisions of other documents, the
reference includes the referenced documents as they may be amended or restated in the
future, and any successor to them, by whatever name called. If any amended or restated
document differs materially from the originally referenced document, the actuary should
consider the guidance in this standard to the extent it is applicable and appropriate.
1.4 Effective Date—This standard is effective for all applicable filing work performed on or
after May 1, 2006.
Section 2. Definitions
The terms below are defined for use in this actuarial standard of practice.
2.1 Financial Projection⎯A projection of covered lives, premiums, claims, expenses, capital
and surplus, or other financial quantities that may be required by applicable law.
2.2 Health Benefit Plan⎯A contract or other financial arrangement providing hospital,
medical, prescription drug, dental, vision, disability income, accidental death and
dismemberment, long-term care, or other health-related benefits, whether on a
reimbursement, indemnity, or service benefit basis, irrespective of the type of health plan
entity that provides the benefits.
2.3 Health Filing⎯A required regulatory filing, at least one element of which requires
projection of future contingent events, for rates or benefits, or financial projections.
Rate or benefit filings include, but are not limited to, the following:
a. filings of manual rates and rating factors;
b. filings of rating methodology, such as experience rating formulas and factors;
c. statements of actuarial soundness or rate adequacy, as may be defined by the
regulatory body, for future rating periods;
d. certification of benefit values; and
e. other filings of similar nature as may be required by the regulatory body.
Financial projection filings include, but are not limited to, any filings in which the
financial projections are a stand-alone requirement, such as those for licensure
ASOP No. 8—December 2005
3
requirements, or are a requirement of a broader filing, such as a rate filing or projections
of future capital and surplus or other regulatory benchmark requirements.
2.4 Health Plan Entity⎯An insurance company, health maintenance organization, hospital or
medical service organization, self-insured health benefit plan sponsor, governmental
health benefit plan sponsor, or any other health benefit plan sponsor from which health
filings are required.
2.5 Regulatory Benchmark⎯A measurement, such as a loss ratio or capital ratio, specified
by applicable law, which is used by the regulatory authority as a basis upon which to
evaluate a health filing.
2.6 Time Value of Money⎯The principle that an amount of money available at an earlier
point in time has different usefulness and value than the same amount of money has at a
later point in time.
Section 3. Analysis of Issues and Recommended Practices
3.1 Introduction—Many jurisdictions require health filings that demonstrate compliance with
applicable law, which may vary considerably as to the requirements and procedures for
these filings. In many cases, such law may be silent as to the assumptions and
methodology to be used, thus giving the actuary significant discretion to exercise
professional judgment in preparing and reviewing the filings.
3.2 Issues and Recommended Practices for Health Filings—The actuary should consider the
following:
3.2.1 Purpose of Filing⎯When preparing a filing, the actuary should include in the
filing a statement of its purpose, identifying the applicable law it is intended to
comply with. For example, the actuary might state, “The only purposes of this rate
filing are to document the rates and to demonstrate that the anticipated loss ratio
of this product with those rates meets the minimum requirements of Section XX
of the statutes of [name of state]. This filing may not be appropriate for other
purposes.”
If, in the actuary’s professional judgment, applicable law is ambiguous, the
actuary should describe how the actuary interpreted the requirements when
preparing the filing. For example, the statute may say, “Provide a business plan
demonstrating future solvency.” The actuary then might state, “This projection of
financial results is intended to demonstrate that the business plan reasonably
anticipates surplus exceeding $XX million for the following Y years.”
3.2.2 Assumptions—The actuary should consider which assumptions are necessary for
the filing. Such assumptions may include the following:
ASOP No. 8—December 2005
4
a. premium levels and future rate changes;
b. enrollment projections;
c. morbidity, mortality, and lapsation levels and trends;
d. expenses, commissions, and taxes;
e. investment earnings and the time value of money;
f. health cost trends;
g. expected financial results, such as profit margin, surplus contribution, and
surplus level;
h. expected impact of contractual arrangements with health care providers
and administrators; and
i. expected impact of reinsurance and other financial arrangements.
3.2.3 Use of Business Plans to Project Future Results⎯The actuary should request and
review any existing and relevant business plans for the health plan entity or health
benefit plan that is the subject of the filing. The actuary should consider the
information therein along with any other information relevant to the business plan
as a part of the setting of the assumptions and methodologies used in the filing.
3.2.4 Use of Past Experience to Project Future Results⎯When setting assumptions, the
actuary should adjust past experience for any known or expected changes that, in
the actuary’s professional judgment, are likely to materially affect expected future
results. These may include, but are not limited to, changes in the following:
a. selection of risks;
b. demographic and risk characteristics of the insured population;
c. policy provisions;
d. business operations;
e. premium rates, claim payments, expenses, and taxes;
f. trends in mortality, morbidity, and lapse; and
g. administrative procedures.
ASOP No. 8—December 2005
5
The actuary should make adjustments to past experience based on earned
premiums and incurred claims, as appropriate, in a way that reasonably matches
claim experience to exposure. For example, the actuary should not use ratios of
paid claims to collected premiums to project future incurred loss ratios except
with appropriate adjustment.
The actuary should update prior earned premium and incurred claim estimates to
reflect premium and claim development experience to date when, in the actuary’s
professional judgment, the difference is material.
The actuary may express past experience in terms of aggregate premium, claim,
and reserve amounts, or in terms of unit results, such as incidence rates and
average premium and claim amounts.
The actuary should consider the applicability and statistical credibility of the data
and make appropriate modifications, if necessary.
3.2.5 Recognition of Plan Provisions⎯The actuary should consider pertinent plan
documents or contracts and, as described to the actuary, established administrative
procedures, any plan interpretations that are not written in the plan documents,
and any arrangements with providers of health care.
3.2.6 New Plans or Benefits⎯The actuary should consider available data relevant to
new plans or benefits. If using a model (for example, in the absence of sufficient
data), the actuary should use a model that is reasonable and consistent with
similar benefits or plans of coverage, if any, and that, if appropriate for the plan or
benefit, takes into account the general characteristics of the health care delivery
system.
3.2.7 Projection of Future Capital and Surplus⎯As part of a health filing, the actuary
may be called upon to project future capital and surplus for the entire health plan
entity or a portion of it, such as a business unit. In doing so, the actuary should
base the projection on reasonable assumptions that take into account any internal
or external future actions as described to the actuary that, in the actuary’s
professional judgment, are likely to have a material effect on capital or surplus.
3.2.8 Regulatory Benchmark⎯The actuary may be called upon to project results in
relation to a regulatory benchmark for the entire health plan entity or a portion of
it, such as a line of business. The actuary should base the projection on
appropriate available information about the relevant book of business.
3.2.9 Reasonableness of Assumptions⎯The actuary should review the assumptions
employed in the filing for reasonableness. The assumptions should be reasonable
in the aggregate and for each assumption individually. The support for
reasonableness should be determined based on the actuary’s professional
judgment, using relevant information available to the actuary. This information
ASOP No. 8—December 2005
6
may include, but is not limited to, business plans; past experience of the health
plan entity or the health benefit plan; and any relevant industry and government
studies that are generally known and reasonably available to the actuary. The
actuary should make a reasonable effort to become familiar with such studies.
3.3 Reliance on Data or Other Information Supplied by Others⎯When relying on data or
other information supplied by others, the actuary should refer to ASOP No. 23, Data
Quality, for guidance.
3.4 Documentation—The actuary should prepare and retain documentation in compliance
with the requirements of ASOP No. 31, Documentation in Health Benefit Plan
Ratemaking, if applicable, and ASOP No. 41, Actuarial Communications. The actuary
should also prepare and retain documentation to demonstrate compliance with the
disclosure requirements of section 4.1.
Section 4. Communications and Disclosures
4.1 Communications and Disclosures⎯When issuing actuarial communications relating to
regulatory filings for health plan entities, the actuary should refer to ASOP No. 23 and
ASOP No. 41. In addition, such actuarial communications should disclose the following:
a. the sources of information;
b. any material information supplied by others and the extent of the actuary’s
reliance on such information;
c. any unresolved concerns the actuary may have about the information that could
have a material effect on the actuarial work product;
d. limitations on the use of the actuarial work product;
e. any conflicts arising from applicable law;
f. the disclosure in ASOP No. 41, section 4.2, if any material assumption or method
was prescribed by applicable law (statutes, regulations, and other legally binding
authority);
g. the disclosure in ASOP No. 41, section 4.3, if the actuary states reliance on other
sources and thereby disclaims responsibility for any material assumption or
method selected by a party other than the actuary; and
h. the disclosure in ASOP No. 41, section 4.4, if, in the actuary’s professional
judgment, the actuary has otherwise deviated materially from the guidance of this
ASOP.

Appendix 1
Background and Current Practices
Note: This appendix is provided for informational purposes but is not part of the standard of
practice.
Background
Many jurisdictions require the filing of actuarial memoranda or similar documents in connection
with health plan entities. An actuary may be involved in the preparation or review of these
filings. The applicable laws differ as to their content, scope, and requirements. Many laws are
silent as to procedures and assumptions to be employed, thus giving the actuary significant
discretion to exercise professional judgment in these areas.
Current Practices
The previous ASOP No. 8 had been in place since 1989. Although the task force believes that the
previous standard represented generally accepted practice, this revision more accurately reflects
current practices.
ASOP No. 8—December 2005

Appendix 2
Comments on the Exposure Draft and Responses
The exposure draft of this revised actuarial standard of practice (ASOP), Regulatory Filings for
Health Plan Entities, was issued in September 2004, with a comment deadline of
March 31, 2005. Fourteen comment letters were received, some of which were submitted on
behalf of multiple commentators, such as by firms or committees. For purposes of this appendix,
the term “commentator” may refer to more than one person associated with a particular comment
letter. The Task Force to Revise ASOP No. 8 carefully considered all comments received.
Summarized below are the significant issues and questions contained in the comment letters and
responses to each, which may have resulted from ASB, Health Committee, or task force
discussion. Unless otherwise noted, the section numbers and titles used below refer to those in
the exposure draft.
GENERAL COMMENTS
Comment
Response
One commentator questioned whether credit disability filings were subject to ASOP No. 8 since
typically such filings require only that the actuary conform to the state’s published “prima facie” rates
and, thus, the filings are not “projections of future contingent events.” The commentator questioned
whether ASOP No. 8 should exclude credit disability in these situations.
The task force did not think such a specific exclusion was appropriate and believed the general
description of inclusions and exclusions was sufficient.
Comment
Response
One commentator noted that some other standards (for example, ASOP Nos. 26 and 28) describe
specific “regulatory filings for health plan entities” and that, either the relationship between these
standards and ASOP No. 8 needed to be clarified in the latter, or that the name of the proposed standard
was too broad and needed to be replaced.
The task force noted that these filings are already specifically excluded in the second paragraph of
section 1.2 and that these exclusions should adequately address these concerns.
Comment
Response
One commentator was concerned that the scope of the proposed ASOP was too broad, stating individual
health insurance carriers are often asked by regulators about the benefit cost(s) of mandates and that,
depending on what the definition of a benefit filing is, almost every request could require more work or
even an actuarial memorandum. Also, in many cases, the regulatory entity has a prescribed form that
does not lend itself to many of the proposed requirements. For example, many states have electronic
forms that allow for entering only a number or a few numbers; in most cases, there is not room to
provide all of the qualifications or caveats that could be included. In addition, there is often no means to
follow up with a full report.
The task force believes that the definition of section 2.4 adequately addresses these concerns. The task
force does not believe requests for information regarding, for example, benefit cost(s) of mandates
would fall under the category of required filings.
Comment
Response
One commentator suggested adding materiality criteria in the section that discusses reasonableness of
assumptions.
The task force chose not to make a distinction between levels of materiality of assumption. The task
force did not want to include a formal definition of materiality in this standard, as materiality is a
subjective concept and often depends on professional judgment.
ASOP No. 8—December 2005

SECTION 1. PURPOSE, SCOPE, CROSS REFERENCES, AND EFFECTIVE DATE
Section 1.1, Purpose
Comment
Response
One commentator stated that “required regulatory filings” is less clear than the language in the prior
standard. One of the most common types of filings is a filing for a rate increase. Most often, the filing
is made to increase rates, not to meet a regulatory requirement to file. The commentator suggested
striking the work “required” and striking it in the second to last paragraph of section 1.2.
The task force noted that it had previously considered this issue and concluded purposely to insert the
word “required” to differentiate between filings that are required by regulatory authorities, such as
those required when filing for a rate increase, and other information that actuaries may submit to
health regulators, such as a regulator’s request for an estimate of the cost impact of a proposed
regulation.
Section 1.2, Scope
Comment
Response
The transmittal memorandum of the exposure draft asked whether the scope was appropriate. One
commentator agreed it was but believed that the second sentence could be clearer if worded as
follows: “Health filings covered by this standard are filings that require projection of future
contingent events in order to meet the given regulatory requirements. These health filings can be
categorized into two broad categories: rate or benefit filings and financial projection filings.”
The task force believes that these concerns are adequately covered in sections 1.2 and section 2.3.
The task force noted that most of the commentators on the first three questions asked in the
transmittal memorandum agreed that the scope was appropriate and that the ASOP was clear as to
whom it applied and to what types of health filings were covered.
Comment
Response
The transmittal memorandum of the exposure draft asked whether the ASOP was clear that it applies
to projections relating to capital and surplus requirements, which would include, for example,
minimum risk-based capital and surplus requirements in states that have adopted the NAIC Risk-
Based Capital (RBC) for Health Organizations Model Act. One commentator stated that, if the ASB
wishes to further emphasize application to projections related to capital and surplus requirements,
then it could include the example given above.
The task force believed the descriptions were sufficiently clear to provide guidance on which filings
were subject to the standard, noting that two other commentators agreed with this.
Comment
Response
One commentator was concerned with the last paragraph regarding conflict with applicable law and
believed that the last phrase should be strengthened to require the actuary to disclose items such as
the nature of the departure from the requirements of the standard, the financial effects thereof, and the
specific provisions of the applicable law.
The task force updated the wording to be consistent with the current language to be used in other
ASOPs and believed the revised language more closely addressed some of the commentator’s
concerns. The task force did not agree that the standard should specify what the actuary’s disclosure
should contain in the event of the standard conflicting with applicable law and believed that the
revised wording, in combination with section 4, Communications and Disclosures, provided adequate
guidance.
Comment
Response
One commentator was concerned that including “case law” and “statutes” in a definition of
applicable law might unreasonably require the actuary to be knowledgeable about court
interpretations or even require the unauthorized practice of law.
The definition of “applicable law” was deleted since it is now defined in “boilerplate” language in
section 1.2. The task force does not believe the definition puts actuaries in the position of
unauthorized practice of law, but the standard does require actuaries to be knowledgeable of
applicable law germane to the actuarial assignment.
ASOP No. 8—December 2005
10
Comment
Response
One commentator suggested that a discussion of any conflict between the standard and applicable law
should be placed in the body of the standard rather than in the scope.
The task force believed the current placement was appropriate and consistent with other ASOPs.
SECTION 2. DEFINITIONS
Section 2.2, Financial Projection (now section 2.1)
Comment
Response
One commentator suggested inserting “covered” before “expenses.”
The task force believed that, if this word were added, the actuary could interpret it to mean expenses
covered, for example, by premiums. Financial projections should include all expenses, which may or
may not be covered by premiums. As such, the task force concluded not to add this word.
Comment
Response
One commentator stated that a projection of covered lives in the absence of financial quantities was
not considered a “financial projection” and that “covered lives” should be removed from the list. The
commentator also suggested changing “administrative expenses” to “expenses” since claims are
expenses too and noted that in other places in the standard “expenses” means “administrative
expenses.”
The task force believed that covered lives often are included in financial projections and should be
included in the projection. The task force also believed that “expenses” as a general term provided
adequate guidance, particularly since claims are mentioned as a separate item.
Section 2.3, Health Benefit Plan (now section 2.2)
Comment
Response
One commentator expressed concern that “health benefit plan” is a defined term in numerous state
insurance laws, but the ASOP defines it differently. The commentator suggested substituting a term
such as “health coverage plan.”
The task force believed that the definition needed to be sufficiently broad and inclusive to cover all
states’ requirements and that definition contained in the exposure draft was sufficiently clear to avoid
confusion with statutory language. The task force noted that terms in section 2 are defined only for
their use within this standard and may depart from definitions used in other actuarial literature.
Comment
Response
One commentator suggested adding “hospital” before “medical” and adding this sentence to the end
of the paragraph: “A discount-only plan is not a health benefit plan.”
The task force agreed and made the first suggested change. On the second suggestion, the task force
noted that, at this time, this type of product would not be subject to this ASOP since it would not
require a health filing as defined under section 2.4 and believed it was unnecessary to add this
sentence.
Section 2.4, Health Filing (now section 2.3)
Comment
Response
One commentator suggested that a definition of “manual rates” be included and that ASOP No. 8
should be expanded to cover the derivation and proper use of manual rates.
The task force believed the term “manual rates” was well enough understood in the context of health
filings and did not need to be defined in this ASOP. The task force did not believe that a discussion
of the derivation or use of manual rates was an appropriate subject for this ASOP.
ASOP No. 8—December 2005
11
Comment
Response
One commentator was concerned that the definition was too restrictive and questioned whether the
phrase “certification of benefit values” includes filings where an actuary certifies that two sets of
benefits are equivalent, which would not always require a projection into the future and may be
strictly based on the current experience.
The task force intends that, for a filing to be subject to this ASOP, the filing be required by a
regulatory authority and that at least one element of the filing requires projection of future contingent
events. If the filing does not have both of these requirements, the filing is not subject to this ASOP. In
the example given by the commentator, if the benefit equivalence calculation requires a projection of
future contingent events, and the actuary chooses to use current experience with zero trend, and the
filing is required by a regulatory authority, the filing would be subject to this ASOP.
Comment
Response
One commentator suggested striking the phrase “as may be defined by the regulatory body” because
it does not help to strengthen the section and may in fact do harm, as applicable law can define
anything as “actuarial soundness” or “rate adequacy.” The power of the “regulatory body” should not
be defined to dictate unsound practice.
The task force noted that it had previously considered this issue and had intentionally concluded to
add this language. The task force had discussed including a definition of “actuarial soundness” in this
ASOP but concluded that “actuarial soundness” is a broader industry issue and decided to limit its
inclusion to cover those situations in which states have specific requirements, for example, that the
actuary opine that the rates are reasonable in relation to the benefits provided or that the rates meet
mandated minimum loss ratio requirements.
Comment
Response
One commentator recommended replacing the last paragraph of the section with the following: “A
financial projection or business plan filing includes, but is not limited to, any filings in which the
financial projections are a stand-alone requirement, such as those for licensure requirements, or are a
requirement of a broader filing, such as a rate filing or projections of future capital and surplus or
other regulatory benchmark requirements.”
The task force noted that the suggested wording was basically the same as that contained in the
exposure draft except adding the wording about business plan. The task force did not believe the
reference to business plan in this paragraph was necessary.
Comment
Response
One commentator stated that the term “health filing” is based on the undefined term “required
regulatory filing.” As a result, the scope of the definition is left unclear. No distinction is made
between a legal requirement and an administrative request that is unsupported by statute or
regulation. The commentator suggested adding the following definition of a required regulatory
filing: “A required regulatory filing is a filing required by statute or regulation.”
The task force believed the definition of “health filing” in the exposure draft provided adequate
guidance and that the proposed definition was circular.
Section 2.7, Time Value of Money (now section 2.6)
Comment
Response
One commentator suggested dropping the phrase “usefulness and” and leaving the term defined in
terms of value only, perhaps by adding the word “monetary” before “value.” Another commentator
believed the definition and references to “earlier” and “later” in particular were not clear.
The task force considered the wording in light of the comments but concluded that the definition,
which is used in other ASOPs, was sufficiently clear.
ASOP No. 8—December 2005

SECTION 3. ANALYSIS OF ISSUES AND RECOMMENDED PRACTICES
Section 3.2.1, Purpose of Filing
Comment
Response
One commentator noted that the example in the second paragraph appeared to provide more precision
than appeared to be implied by the requirement in the first sentence of this paragraph, which required
the actuary only to “describe” the interpretation of the regulatory requirements. The commentator
questioned what level of precision is appropriate for the description and believed that “describe” does
not provide any notion of the degree of completeness needed.
The task force believed the wording was appropriate and did not believe the standard should be too
prescriptive.
Section 3.2.2, Consistency With Business Plan (now section 3.2.2, Assumptions, and section 3.2.3, Use of
Business Plans to Project Future Results)
Comment
Response
One commentator suggested alternative language that would require assumptions to be consistent
with contemporaneous health filings relating to the health benefit plan subject to the current filing;
one commentator suggested strengthening the requirement that “the actuary should use assumptions
and methodologies that are consistent with the business plan….”
Section 3.2.2 from the exposure draft was reorganized into new sections 3.2.2, Assumptions, and
3.2.3, Use of Business Plans to Project Future Results, to better address these different but connected
issues.
Comment
Response
One commentator noted that the term “persistency” appears without definition. While the term has an
unambiguous meaning in an individual life insurance setting, it could have multiple applications in
the health insurance arena.
The task force considered this and believed that the meaning should be clear within the context of
each filing. The task force did not believe a definition was necessary.
Comment
Response
One commentator stated that, in any given filing, certain assumptions may not be material and that
this should be so noted in the ASOP.
The task force did not believe such a statement was necessary. As noted in the task force’s response
to the last comment under General Comments, the task force chose not to make a distinction between
levels of materiality of assumptions and did not want to include a formal definition of materiality in
this standard, as materiality is a subjective concept and often depends on professional judgment.
Comment Several commentators expressed concerns and raised important issues and questions on the opening
paragraph of this section, including the following:
One commentator found that certain terms such as “business plan,” “sales results,” and “overall” in
“overall business results” were undefined.
One commentator questioned whether the relevant sections of the business plan should be disclosed
in the actuarial communication.
One commentator believed the phrase “as known to the actuary” was too lenient and that the actuary
should review the components of the business plan that are relevant to the determination of
reasonable assumptions.
One commentator noted that business plans developed by health plans to support the internal plan
management serve a different purpose than the projections used to support pricing and regulatory
filings. For example, they are often intended to set challenging performance goals rather than most
likely outcome. The commentator stated that it would be inappropriate to base pricing assumptions on
such projections, as there is no guarantee that they represent a reasonable expectation of future
experience. Further, the commentator suggested that business plans subject to regulatory filing and
review should be included in the definition of a health filing.
ASOP No. 8—December 2005
13
Response The task force agreed with many of the comments and renamed the title and rewrote the section to
address these issues. It is recognized there are many types of business plans, ranging from formal
written documents to informal verbal discussions. To avoid being prescriptive, the language was
changed to require the consideration of relevant information from whatever business plan exists and
included wording about requesting such plan, although obvious. The task force removed references to
consistent assumptions. The task force believed that the issue regarding documentation is adequately
covered in sections 3.4 and section 4.1.
Comment
Response
One commentator found that sections 3.2.2 and 3.2.3 of the exposure draft when read together were
troublesome. Section 3.2.2 would have required consistency with the business plan. Section 3.2.3.
would have described a review for reasonableness versus, among other factors, the business plan. The
commentator proposed several changes to both sections, including a proposed redraft of section 3.2.2.
The task force substantially rewrote sections 3.2.2 and 3.2.3, (now sections 3.2.2, 3.2.3, and 3.2.9,
Reasonableness of Assumptions) and believes that these revisions adequately address the concerns
mentioned.
Section 3.2.3, Reasonableness of Assumptions (now section 3.2.9)
Comment
Response
One commentator questioned whether the actuary should state the extent to which the assumptions
are the actuary’s own or that he or she is reviewing those of some other technician (who may or may
not be an actuary) and perhaps assessing them to meet only the lower standard of “not unreasonable”
or “in a reasonable range.” The commentator stated that two aspects should be reported: (a) the
applicable standard of reasonableness; and (b) who the author is. The commentator noted that, in
assessing anything prepared by an actuary, the actuary’s assessment is going to be strongly affected
by whether the assumptions were devised by the signing actuary or by someone else and, for that
matter, whether the actuary was independent or employed by the organization from which the
assumptions came and questioned whether that should be the case.
The task force rewrote this section and believes that this revision addresses many of the
commentator’s concerns.
Comment
Response
One commentator stated that two ideas seem important here. First, the model chosen can be important
because some models make assumptions explicit while other models make the same assumptions
implicit. Second, it seems inappropriate to exempt implicit assumptions from the same scrutiny as the
explicit assumptions. The commentator suggested renaming the section “Reasonableness of
Projection Model and Assumptions.”
The task force believed that no change was necessary since this section applies to all assumptions,
both implicit and explicit.
Comment
Response
Two commentators raised the issue regarding materiality of assumptions and suggested wording
changes to the effect that “each material assumption should be reasonable.”
The task force believed that it was important that all assumptions be identified and that the support
for reasonableness of the assumptions be based on the actuary’s professional judgment. As noted in
the task force’s response to the last comment under General Comments, the task force chose not to
make a distinction between levels of materiality of assumptions and did not want to include a formal
definition of materiality in this standard, as materiality is a subjective concept and often depends on
professional judgment.
Comment
Response
One commentator recommended retaining the old language in this section requiring assumptions to
be reasonable based on all information available to the actuary and suggested replacing the last two
sentences with the following: “The support for reasonableness should be determined based on the
actuary’s professional judgment, using relevant information available to the actuary. This information
may include, but is not limited to, past experience of the health plan entity or the health benefit plan,
and any relevant industry and government studies.”
The task force substantially agreed with most of the commentator’s comments and made appropriate
changes to this section while adding another sentence outlining the actuary’s duty to make a
reasonable effort to become familiar with relevant studies.
ASOP No. 8—December 2005
14
Section 3.2.4, Use of Past Experience to Project Future Results
Comment
Response
One commentator suggested striking “in the actuary’s professional judgment,” citing it extraneous.
The task force believed that decisions about materiality often depend on the actuary’s professional
judgment and, as such, concluded not to strike those words.
Comment
Response
One commentator suggested that, in 3.2.4(d) the comma between “benefit” and “expense” be
replaced with the word “and.”
The task force clarified this section (now section 3.2.4 (e)) with revised wording.
Comment
Response
One commentator recommended including the concept of “known” changes in the first paragraph and
noted that there may be changes that have taken place between the end of the experience period and
the date of the filing that are known and will materially affect expected future results.
The task force agreed and made the change.
Comment
Response
One commentator noted the wording of item 3.2.4(e) is potentially confusing and recommended using
either “trends in mortality and morbidity” or “trends in mortality and in the utilization and cost of
services.”
The task force agreed and revised the section (now section 3.2.4(f)) for clarity.
Comment
Response
One commentator stated that the discussion in the second paragraph refers to paid and incurred
“claims” and to “earned premiums,” etc., and yet the principles are more general and extend beyond
premiums and claims to any financial flows with similar characteristics, for example, capitation
income and payments, government subsidy or “reinsurance” payments, risk adjustments, state risk
pool assessments, etc. The commentator asked whether more general language should be used.
The task force believed that more general language was not necessary. The items mentioned are, for
the most part, an element of premiums or incurred claims, for example, capitation income would be
part of earned premiums and capitation payments are a part of incurred claims.
Section 3.2.5, Recognition of Plan Provisions
Comment
Response
One commentator stated that the phrase “as described to the actuary” in this context should be
acceptable only if such descriptions are carefully documented with sufficient specificity to designate
the contract provisions precisely.
The task force believed that this is adequately covered with the requirements in sections 3.4 and
section 4.1.
Comment
Response
One commentator found the meaning “plan documents” unclear and questioned whether it could
include employer contracts, employee certificates, group administration manuals, provider contracts,
etc.
The task force believed that plan documents and unwritten procedures, such as those mentioned by
the commentator, can provide useful information about the plan. The task force believed that further
clarification was not necessary.
ASOP No. 8—December 2005
15
Section 3.2.6, New Plans or Benefits
Comment
Response
One commentator suggested that the first sentence could be shortened to say, “The actuary should
consider available relevant data,” because the wording as it stands almost limits the paragraph to an
actuary on the filing end and excludes the actuary on the reviewing end.
The task force agreed and rewrote this sentence to clarify the language.
Comment
Response
One commentator recommended rewording the second sentence of this section as follows: “In the
absence of such data, the actuary should use a reasonable model that is consistent with similar
benefits or plans of coverage offered by the health plan entity and that, if appropriate for the plan or
benefit, takes into account the general characteristics of the health care delivery system.”
Another commentator believed that the second sentence was incomplete in that the model, by itself,
does nothing and that the standard should state what to do with the model. The commentator believed
that the standard meant that the actuary should consider the elements of the new benefits, find other
existing coverages that have matching benefits to the new plan, see if the experience would apply to
the new plan, and, if it does not, keep looking until a match is found.
This section was rewritten. Although the wording is very similar, the phrasing has been rearranged
somewhat for clarification. With regards to the second comment, the task force means that the
actuary is to select a model that is intended to develop data that can be used for estimating the value
of new plans or benefits from data on existing plans, when directly relevant data on the new plan are
not available. The language does not require that the benefits and the experience match exactly. As
with all other items under section 3.2, the results of such a model would be considered for the health
filing.
Section 3.2.7, Projection of Future Capital and Surplus
Comment
Response
One commentator stated that the phrase “as described to the actuary” should not be used without a
requirement to document what was described to the actuary.
The task force believes that this is adequately covered with the requirements in sections 3.4 and
section 4.1.
Section 3.2.8, Investment Income
Comment
Response
One commentator recommended revising section 3.2.8 of the exposure draft by substituting
“reasonable earnings rates” for “a reasonable earnings rate.” This would (a) allow for earnings rates
varying by the average duration of liabilities; and (b) leave room for stochastic interest rate studies
(admittedly rare at present, but a concern for very long-term products such as LTC). The present
wording seems to require use of a single rate.
This section was deleted but the term “investment earnings” has been included without further
description in the list of assumption in new section 3.2.2, Assumptions.
Section 3.2.9, Regulatory Benchmark (now section 3.2.8)
Comment
Response
One commentator believed that the second sentence was a general statement that applied to any filing
and, thus, belonged in section 3.2.4. The commentator suggested that, if it is desirable to mention
regulatory benchmark in the standard, it should be done in section 3.2.1.
The task force believed that sections 3.2.4 and 3.2.6 already provide for the use of appropriate
relevant information in their respective descriptions. The task force considered the commentator’s
second suggestion regarding having regulatory benchmark be a part of section 3.2.1. The task force
concluded to keep it as a separate subsection under section 3.2 because of the importance and relative
uniqueness of these types of projections.

Section 3.3, Reliance On Others (now Reliance on Data or Other Information Supplied by Others)
Comment
Response
One commentator recommended that the word “descriptions” be included so that it would read,
“…on information, including data and descriptions….”
Another commentator expressed concern about the reliance on information supplied by others and
any due diligence the actuary should perform on that information.
The task force revised this section to be consistent with language used in other current ASOPs and
notes that ASOP No. 23, Data Quality, provides expanded guidance on these issues.
SECTION 4. COMMUNICATIONS AND DISCLOSURES
Section 4.1, Communication and Disclosures
Comment
Response
One commentator expressed concern with item 4.1(b), stating actuaries will adopt blanket boilerplate
statements that absolve them of the responsibility to inform the employer or client who may rely on
their judgments and what they relied on.
The task force agreed and modified the language.
Comment
Response
One commentator expressed a concern about whether the actuary has been required to estimate the
extent that adopting an assumption dictated by laws or regulations has changed the results of the
calculations. The commentator suggested that one way to do this would be to make section 4.1(e)
more explicit, for example, by stating, “any conflicts arising from applicable law or regulations and
their effects on the calculations.”
The task force decided not to change the language from that contained in the exposure draft. The task
force believed that this suggested requirement would put a greater burden on the actuary and does not
necessarily reflect generally accepted practice. It may be a good thing to know but would not be part
of a required regulatory filing.

1. Objective
As part of its responsibility, Infomineo is committed to international compliance with data protection laws. This Data
Protection Policy applies worldwide to Infomineo and is based on globally accepted, basic principles on data
protection. Ensuring data protection is the foundation of trustworthy business relationships and the reputation of
Infomineo as an attractive employer or partner. The Data Protection Policy provides one of the necessary framework
conditions for cross-border data transmission. It ensures the adequate level of data protection prescribed by the
GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and the national laws (Morocco, namely Act 09-08) for cross-border data
transmission, including in countries that do not yet have adequate data protection laws.
2. Scope
This policy aims at the protection of privacy to personal data processing when the person responsible for processing—
being either an individual or a legal entity—is established on Moroccan territory or in EU countries.
This policy applies where we are acting as a Data Controller with respect to the personal data of employees or users
of our Services; in other words, where we determine the purposes and means of the processing of that personal data.
It also applies to Infomineo website, as well as other interaction (e.g. customer support conversations, user surveys
and interviews etc.) you may have with Infomineo.
3. Responsibility
The Management are responsible for data processing in their area of responsibility. Therefore, they are required to
ensure that the legal requirements, and those contained in the Data Protection Policy, for data protection are met.
Management staff are responsible for ensuring that organizational, HR, and technical measures are in place so that
any data processing is carried out in accordance with data protection.
4. Abbreviations/Definition
▪ Data is anonymized if personal identity can never be traced by anyone, or if the personal identity
could be recreated only with an unreasonable amount of time, expense and labor.
▪ Consent is the voluntary, legally binding agreement to data processing.
▪ Data subject under this Data Privacy Policy is any natural person whose data can be processed.
▪ Processing personal data means any process, with or without the use of automated systems, to
collect, store, organize, retain, modify, query, use, forward, transmit, disseminate or combine and
compare data. This also includes disposing of, deleting and blocking data and data storage media.

▪ Third parties are anyone apart from the data subject and the Data Controller. Transmission is all
disclosure of protected data by the responsible entity to third parties.
▪ Highly sensitive data is data about racial and ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or
philosophical beliefs, union membership or the health and sexual life of the data subject. Under
national law, further data categories can be considered highly sensitive or the content of the data
categories can be structured differently.
5. Personal data protection principles
▪ Fairness and lawfulness; When processing personal data, the individual rights of the data
subjects must be protected. Personal data must be collected and processed in a legal and fair
manner.
▪ Restriction to a specific purpose; Personal data can be processed only for the purpose that was
defined before the data was collected. Subsequent changes to the purpose are only possible to a
limited extent and require substantiation.
▪ Transparency; The data subject must be informed of how his/her data is being handled. In general,
personal data must be collected directly from the individual concerned. When the data is collected,
the data subject must either be aware of, or informed of:
o the identity of the Data Controller
o the purpose of data processing
o third parties or categories of third parties to whom the data might be transmitted.
▪ Data reduction and data economy; Before processing personal data, you must determine
whether and to what extent the processing of personal data is necessary in order to achieve the
purpose for which it is undertaken. Where the purpose allows and where the expense involved is
in proportion with the goal being pursued, anonymized or statistical data must be used. Personal
data may not be collected in advance and stored for potential future purposes unless required or
permitted by national law.
▪ Deletion; Personal data that is no longer needed after the expiration of legal or business process-
related periods must be deleted. There may be an indication of interests that merit protection or
historical significance of this data in individual cases. If so, the data must remain on file until the
interests that merit protection have been clarified legally, or the corporate archive has evaluated
the data to determine whether it must be retained for historical purposes.

▪ Factual accuracy; up-to-dateness of data; Personal data on file must be correct, complete, and
– if necessary – kept up to date. Suitable steps must be taken to ensure that inaccurate or
incomplete data are deleted, corrected, supplemented or updated.
▪ Confidentiality and data security; Personal data is subject to data secrecy. It must be treated as
confidential on a personal level and secured with suitable organizational and technical measures
to prevent unauthorized access, illegal processing or distribution, as well as accidental loss,
modification or destruction.
6. Reliability of data processing
Collecting, processing and using personal data is permitted only under the following legal bases. One of
these legal bases is also required if the purpose of collecting, processing and using the personal data is
to be changed from the original purpose.
1) Customer and partner data
a. Data processing for a contractual relationship; Personal data of the relevant prospects,
customers and partners can be processed to establish, execute and terminate a contract.
This also includes advisory services for the partner under the contract if this is related to
the contractual purpose. Prior to a contract – during the contract initiation phase – personal
data can be processed to prepare bids or purchase orders or to fulfill other requests of the
prospect that relate to contract conclusion. Prospects can be contacted during the contract
preparation process using the information that they have provided. Any restrictions
requested by the prospects must be complied with.
b. Data processing for advertising purposes; If the data subject contacts Infomineo to
request information (e.g. request to receive information), data processing to meet this
request is permitted. Customer loyalty or advertising measures are subject to further legal
requirements. Personal data can be processed for advertising purposes or market and
opinion research, provided that this is consistent with the purpose for which the data was
originally collected. The data subject must be informed about the use of his/her data for
advertising purposes. If data is collected only for advertising purposes, the disclosure from
the data subject is voluntary. The data subject shall be informed that providing data for this
purpose is voluntary. When communicating with the data subject, consent shall be obtained
from him/her to process the data for advertising purposes. When giving consent, the data
subject should be given a choice among available forms of contact such as regular mail,
POL/023

Data Privacy Policy VERSION NO.
EFFECTIVE DATE
Infomineo Internal/External Page 6 of 17
e-mail and phone. If the data subject refuses the use of his/her data for advertising
purposes, it can no longer be used for these purposes and must be blocked from use for
these purposes. Any other restrictions from specific countries regarding the use of data for
advertising purposes must be observed.
c. Consent to data processing Data can be processed following consent by the data
subject. Before giving consent, the data subject must be informed in accordance with Data
Protection Policy principles. The declaration of consent must be obtained in writing or
electronically for the purposes of documentation. In some circumstances, such as
telephone conversations, consent can be given verbally. The granting of consent must be
documented.
d. Data processing pursuant to legal authorization; The processing of personal data is
also permitted if national legislation requests, requires or allows this. The type and extent
of data processing must be necessary for the legally authorized data processing activity,
and must comply with the relevant statutory provisions. Reliability of data processing
Collecting, processing and using personal data is permitted only under the following legal
bases. One of these legal bases is also required if the purpose of collecting, processing
and using the personal data is to be changed from the original purpose.
e. Data processing pursuant to legitimate interest; Personal data can also be processed
if it is necessary for a legitimate interest of Infomineo. Legitimate interests are generally of
a legal (e.g. collection of outstanding receivables) or commercial nature (e.g. avoiding
breaches of contract). Personal data may not be processed for the purposes of a legitimate
interest if, in individual cases, there is evidence that the interests of the data subject merit
protection, and that this takes precedence. Before data is processed, it is necessary to
determine whether there are interests that merit protection.
f. Processing of highly sensitive data; Highly sensitive personal data can be processed
only if the law requires this or the data subject has given express consent. This data can
also be processed if it is mandatory for asserting, exercising or defending legal claims
regarding the data subject. If there are plans to process highly sensitive data.
g. Automated individual decisions; Automated processing of personal data that is used to
evaluate certain aspects cannot be the sole basis for decisions that have negative legal
consequences or could significantly impair the data subject. The data subject must be
informed of the facts and results of automated individual decisions and the possibility to

Infomineo Internal/External Page 7 of 17
respond. To avoid erroneous decisions, a test and plausibility check must be made by an
employee.
h. User data and internet; If personal data is collected, processed and used on websites or
in apps, the data subjects must be informed of this in a privacy statement and, if applicable,
information about cookies. The privacy statement and any cookie information must be
integrated so that it is easy to identify, directly accessible and consistently available for the
data subjects. If use profiles (tracking) are created to evaluate the use of websites and
apps, the data subjects must always be informed accordingly in the privacy statement.
Personal tracking may only be effected if it is permitted under national law or upon consent
of the data subject. If tracking uses a pseudonym, the data subject should be given the
chance to opt out in the privacy statement. If websites or apps can access personal data
in an area restricted to registered users, the identification and authentication of the data
subject must offer sufficient protection during access.
2) Employee data
a. Data processing for the employment relationship; In employment relationships,
personal data can be processed if needed to initiate, carry out and terminate the
employment agreement. When initiating an employment relationship, the applicants’
personal data can be processed. If the candidate is rejected, his/her data must be deleted
in observance of the required retention period, unless the applicant has agreed to remain
on file for a future selection process. Consent is also needed to use the data for further
application processes or before sharing the application with other third parties. In the
existing employment relationship, data processing must always relate to the purpose of the
employment agreement if none of the following circumstances for authorized data
processing apply. If it should be necessary during the application procedure to collect
information on an applicant from a third party, the requirements of the corresponding
national laws must be observed. In cases of doubt, consent must be obtained from the data
subject. There must be legal authorization to process personal data that is related to the
employment relationship but was not originally part of performance of the employment
agreement. This can include legal requirements, collective regulations with employee
representatives, consent of the employee, or the legitimate interest of the company.
b. Data processing pursuant to legal authorization; The processing of personal employee
data is also permitted if national legislation requests, requires or authorizes this. The type
POL/023
2.0

EFFECTIVE DATE
Infomineo Internal/External Page 8 of 17
and extent of data processing must be necessary for the legally authorized data processing
activity, and must comply with the relevant statutory provisions. If there is some legal
flexibility, the interests of the employee that merit protection must be taken into
consideration.
c. Collective agreements on data processing; If a data processing activity exceeds the
purposes of fulfilling a contract, it may be permissible if authorized through a collective
agreement. Collective agreements are pay scale agreements or agreements between
employers and employee representatives, within the scope allowed under the relevant
employment law. The agreements must cover the specific purpose of the intended data
processing activity, and must be drawn up within the parameters of national data protection
legislation.
d. Consent to data processing; Employee data can be processed upon consent of the
person concerned. Declarations of consent must be submitted voluntarily. Involuntary
consent is void. The declaration of consent must be obtained in writing or electronically for
the purposes of documentation. In certain circumstances, consent may be given verbally,
in which case it must be properly documented. In the event of informed, voluntary provision
of data by the relevant party, consent can be assumed if national laws do not require
express consent. Before giving consent, the data subject must be informed in accordance
with Data Protection Policy principles.
e. Data processing pursuant to legitimate interest; Personal data can also be processed
if it is necessary to enforce a legitimate interest of Infomineo. Legitimate interests are
generally of a legal (e.g. filing, enforcing or defending against legal claims) or financial (e.g.
valuation of companies) nature. Personal data may not be processed based on a legitimate
interest if, in individual cases, there is evidence that the interests of the employee merit
protection. Before data is processed, it must be determined whether there are interests
that merit protection. Control measures that require processing of employee data can be
taken only if there is a legal obligation to do so or there is a legitimate reason. Even if there
is a legitimate reason, the proportionality of the control measure must also be examined.
The justified interests of the company in performing the control measure (e.g. compliance
with legal provisions and internal company rules) must be weighed against any interests
meriting protection that the employee affected by the measure may have in its exclusion,
and cannot be performed unless appropriate. The legitimate interest of the company and
POL/023
2.0

Policy DOCUMENT ID
Data Privacy Policy VERSION NO.
EFFECTIVE DATE
Infomineo Internal/External Page 9 of 17
any interests of the employee meriting protection must be identified and documented
before any measures are taken.
f. Processing of highly sensitive data; Highly sensitive personal data can be processed
only under certain conditions. Highly sensitive data is data about racial and ethnic origin,
political beliefs, religious or philosophical beliefs, union membership, and the health and
sexual life of the data subject. Under national law, further data categories can be
considered highly sensitive or the content of the data categories can be filled out differently.
The processing must be expressly permitted or prescribed under national law.
g. Automated decisions; If personal data is processed automatically as part of the
employment relationship, and specific personal details are evaluated (e.g. as part of
personnel selection or the evaluation of skills profiles), this automatic processing cannot
be the sole basis for decisions that would have negative consequences or significant
problems for the affected employee. To avoid erroneous decisions, the automated process
must ensure that a natural person evaluates the content of the situation, and that this
evaluation is the basis for the decision. The data subject must also be informed of the facts
and results of automated individual decisions and the possibility to respond.
h. Telecommunications and internet; Telephone equipment, e-mail addresses, intranet
and internet along with internal social networks are provided by the company primarily for
work-related assignments. They are a tool and a company resource. They can be used
within the applicable legal regulations and internal company policies. In the event of
authorized use for private purposes, the laws on secrecy of telecommunications and the
relevant national telecommunication laws must be observed if applicable. There will be no
general monitoring of telephone and e-mail communications or intranet/ internet use. To
defend against attacks on the IT infrastructure or individual users, protective measures can
be implemented for the connections to Infomineo network that block technically harmful
content or that analyze the attack patterns. For security reasons, the use of telephone
equipment, e-mail addresses, the intranet/internet and internal social networks can be
logged for a temporary period. Evaluations of this data from a specific person can be made
only in a concrete, justified case of suspected violations of laws or policies of Infomineo.
The evaluations can be conducted only by investigating departments while ensuring that
the principle of proportionality is met. The relevant national laws must be observed in the
same manner as Infomineo regulations.

7. Transmission of personal data
Transmission of personal data to recipients outside or inside Infomineo is subject to the authorization
requirements for processing personal data. The data recipient must be required to use the data only for the
defined purposes. In the event that data is transmitted to a recipient outside Infomineo to a third country
this country must agree to maintain a data protection level equivalent to this Data Protection Policy. This
does not apply if transmission is based on a legal obligation. If data is transmitted by a third party to a
Infomineo, it must be ensured that the data can be used for the intended purpose.
8. Rights of the data subject
Every data subject has the following rights. Their assertion is to be handled immediately by the responsible
unit and cannot pose any disadvantage to the data subject.
a. The data subject may request information on which personal data relating to him/her has been
stored, how the data was collected, and for what purpose. If there are further rights to view the
employer’s documents (e.g. personnel file) for the employment relationship under the relevant
employment laws, these will remain unaffected.
b. If personal data is transmitted to third parties, information must be given about the identity of the
recipient or the categories of recipients.
c. If personal data is incorrect or incomplete, the data subject can demand that it be corrected or
supplemented.
d. The data subject can object to the processing of his or her data for purposes of advertising or
market/opinion research. The data must be blocked from these types of use.
e. The data subject may request his/her data to be deleted if the processing of such data has no legal
basis, or if the legal basis has ceased to apply. The same applies if the purpose behind the data
processing has lapsed or ceased to be applicable for other reasons. Existing retention periods and
conflicting interests meriting protection must be observed.
f. The data subject generally has a right to object to his/her data being processed, and this must be
considered if the protection of his/her interests takes precedence over the interest of the data
controller owing to a particular personal situation. This does not apply if a legal provision requires
the data to be processed.
9. Confidentiality of processing
Personal data is subject to data secrecy. Any unauthorized collection, processing, or use of such data by
employees is prohibited. Any data processing undertaken by an employee that he/she has not been

authorized to carry out as part of his/her legitimate duties is unauthorized. The “need to know” principle
applies. Employees may have access to personal information only as is appropriate for the type and scope
of the task in question. This requires a careful breakdown and separation, as well as implementation, of
roles and responsibilities. Employees are forbidden to use personal data for private or commercial
purposes, to disclose it to unauthorized persons, or to make it available in any other way. Managers must
inform their employees at the start of the employment relationship about the obligation to protect data

Purpose
EIA is intended to identify the impacts (both beneficial and adverse) of a proposed public and private
development activities. Often, the focus is dominantly environmental (biophysical); but good practice
also addresses social and economic aspects. EIA is mainly used at the level of specific developments
and projects such as dams, industrial plants, transport infrastructure (eg airport runways and roads),
farm enterprises, natural resource exploitation (eg sand extraction). Strategic environmental assessment
(SEA) is a sister tool applied upstream at the level of policies, plans and programmes. Like SEA, EIA
is most valuable when applied early in the planning process for a project as a support to decision-
making. It provides a means to identify the most environmentally suitable option at an early stage, the
best practicable environmental option, and alternatives to the proposed initiative; and thus avoid or
minimise potentially damaging and costly negative impacts, and maximise positive impacts.
Background facts
EIA was first introduced in the USA under the Environmental Policy Act (1969). Since then it has
evolved and a variety of offshoot assessment techniques have emerged (focusing, for example on
social, biodiversity, environmental health and cumulative effects and risk) acting as a broader impact
assessment toolkit.
Most countries have now introduced formal EIA systems, usually under dedicated environmental
legislation, and have introduced EIA regulations (and often regulatory bodies) specifying when and for
which developments an EIA is required, institutional responsibilities and procedures, and specific steps
and processes to be followed.
Brief description of the main steps involved in application of the tool:
Key stages in the Environmental Assessment process include: screening, alternatives, preliminary
assessment, scoping, mitigation, main EIA study and environmental impact statement, review and
monitoring (Box 5.1 and Figure 5.1). These need to be managed so that they provide information to
decision-makers at every stage of the project planning cycle (Figure 5.2).
Box 1: Steps in EIA
(1) Screening (usually by an EIA Authority, or using published checklists) – to decide whether an
EIA is required and focus resources on projects most likely to have significant impacts, those where
impacts are uncertain and those where environmental management input is likely to be required..
Official EIA guidelines usually contain lists or schedules specifying which developments require an
EIA (eg always, or in particular circumstances).
(2) Consideration of possible alternatives (demand, activity, location, process & design, scheduling,
inputs, ‘no project’) should be undertaken before a choice is made. Some projects can be site specific
(eg in mining, extraction can only occur were a mineral is sited). In such cases the EIA might focus
more on measures such as scale, mitigating measures and traffic management. Projects promoted by
public sector agencies are more likely to consider alternative sites or routes for development than
private sector initiatives where the early need to acquire options or purchase land strongly influences
development location.
(3) Preliminary assessment - where screening suggests further assessment is needed or if there is
uncertainty about the nature of potential impacts. Uses rapid assessment techniques, but provides
sufficient detail to identify key impacts, their magnitude and significance, and evaluate their
importance for decision-making. Indicates if a full EIA is needed. - involving the following steps.
(4) Scoping –a ‘narrowing’ process usually undertaken by an ‘assessment team’ to identify the key
issues of concern at an early stage in the planning process and guide the development of terms of
reference for the EIA. It aids site selection, identifies possible alternatives, and avoids delays due to
having to assess previously unidentified possible impacts. Scoping should involve all interested
parties such as the proponent and planning or environmental agencies and members of the public. The
results determine the scope, depth and terms of reference to be addressed within an Environmental
Impact Statement (see below). Once the site for development has been selected, the number of issues
usually decreases and attention to detail increases.
(5) Main EIA study – building on and deepening the preceding steps to predict the extent and
magnitude of impacts and determine their significance. A variety of methods can be used including:
checklists, questionnaires, matrices, overlays, networks, models and simulations. The study should
incorporate consideration of mitigating measures - reviewing the action proposed/taken to prevent,
avoid or minimise actual or potential significant adverse effects of a project, eg abandoning or
modifying a proposal, or substituting techniques using BATNEEC (Best Available Technology Not
Entailing Excessive Costs) such as pollution abatement techniques to reduce emissions to legal limits.
If the uncertainties are great, with the possibility of grave consequences and no mitigating measures
then the proposed development should be rejected. If there are uncertainties that might be reduced by
further studies, then an application can be deferred pending until further studies. Where mitigation is
inappropriate, compensation may be an option.
An Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is a comprehensive document that reports the findings of
the EIA and now often required by law before a new project can proceed. A typical EIS, usually
prepared by the project on behalf of the proponent (usually by consultants), focuses on the issues most
relevant to decision-making. It can be broken down into three parts with different levels of detail:
• Volume 1 - a comprehensive and concise document drawing together all relevant information
regarding the development project;
• Non-Technical Summary (NTS) - a brief report of volume 1 in non-technical language that can
easily be understood by the public;
• Volume 2 - a volume that contains a detailed assessment of the significant environmental
effects.(not necessary when there are no significant effects either before or after mitigation).
Alternative communication approaches by also be appropriate where literacy or social/cultural
barriers prevent local people accessing the EIS. (eg local language videos, presentations, radio
programmes, meetings and workshops)
(6) Review – to assess the adequacy of the EIA to decision-making and consider its implications for
project implementation (in some countries, such review is a formal and independent process)
(7) Monitoring of project implementation and operation (including decommissioning) , and
eventually an audit of the project after its completion.
Figure 1: The EIA process Figure 2: The project planning cycle
Expected outputs
• An Environmental Impact Statement that provides clear, understandable, relevant information to
influence the final decision on the development project.
• A better development project (minimised negative impacts, maximised positive impacts, optimal
location, best alternative selected, etc)
Basic requirements
For a major project, an EIA may take considerable time, manpower and resources. The first four stages
(Box 1) are very important to determine the required extent and focus of the EIA.
Data
Prediction of impacts relies on data from a variety of sources: physical, biological and sociological. Its
quality will often impose constraints on accuracy and reliability of predictions. Where data is limited,
qualitative techniques will need to be used
Cost – usually less than 1% of overall project costs – the table shows example EIA costs for four World
Bank projects.
Type of project Cost of EIA
(000, US$)
Project cost
(000, US$)
% of total project

Thermal power generation, Ghana 250 400,000 0.06
Forest management, Tanzania 131 26,000 0.50
Energy sector development, Kenya 510 1,000,000 0.05
Energy sector development, Malawi 180 231,300 0.08
Skills and capacity – often a multidisciplinary team is required – particularly where scoping indicates
the existence of multiple or complex issues.
Pros (main advantages) and Cons (main constraints in use and results)
• EIA often focuses on biophysical issues (often a fault of poor terms of reference);
• Where environment, social and economic aspects are addressed, they are not always addressed in
an integrated way (EIA reports tend to present as separate chapters)
• EIA provides an opportunity to learn from experience of similar projects and avoids the (often
high) costs of subsequently mitigating unforeseen negative and damaging impacts.
• EIA Improves long-term viability of many projects
Box 5.2: Case Study: EIA Mkuze River Crossing to Phelendaba, South Africa
A relatively small EIA of a proposed road development in Maputaland, South Africa was conducted
in 1999 for the South African Roads Agency, Department of Transport. The road formed a key
infrastructural component of a Spatial Development Initiative aiming to provide a direct link between
northern KwaZulu-Natal and Mozambique to encourage rapid investment and convert the area into an
internationally competitive zone of economic activity and growth. The project aimed to tar the road,
upgrade river crossings and construct a new crossing over a swamp. The undeveloped area dominated
by subsistence agriculture had high levels of poverty and unemployment but high bio-diversity value
and high eco-tourism potential.
An extended scoping study proved adequate for decision-making, despite the complexity of the
issues. It proved unnecessary to undertake an intensive, detailed EIA that would have had significant
time and resource implications.
The study involved extensive stakeholder participation. Because of the eco-tourism potential of pans
in the area, the KwaZulu-Natal Nature Conservation Service (KZNNCS) proposed an alternative
routing for the roadway (the western alignment), arguing that this would provide greater access to the
Kwa-Jobe Tribal Authority – an extremely poor community.
The existing route was shorter and therefore cheaper, and most of its alignment was already cleared -
so linear developments and other disturbances already existed. But it passed through a state forest
with hazards to game and game hazards to traffic, opportunistic poaching and noise from the road.
The alternative western alignment required clearing 140 ha of mature Sand Forest and could open
access to uncontrolled woodcutting. But benefits included expanding the width of a migration corridor
between the Mkuze Game Reserve and the Sodwana State Forest. This route would also have
eliminated the need to cross the Mozi Swamp.
The proposed upgrading of the swamp crossing would result in several positive impacts including
removing barriers to fish migration, improving access to Kwa-Jobe, increase the frequency of water
exchanges, reducing the hyper-salinity in Lake St Lucia and improved fish yields. Negative impacts
included constricting water movement, possible embankment collapse during heavy floods and a
reduction in hydrologic pressure on the Mkhuze Swamp during floods.
The scooping study concluded that the eastern (existing) alignment was preferable especially given
the vehement opposition expressed by Tribal authorities to the western (alternative) alignment. A
stringent Environmental Management Programme (EMP) was recommended to govern all

I. Introduction
1. The permitting, licensing or authorization of installations and activities by designated
authorities is essential for ensuring the environmentally sound management (ESM) of hazardous waste
and other waste. This manual provides information on procedures and requirements associated with
permits, licenses and authorizations.
2. This manual provides a general overview of how to establish procedures and requirements for
facilities to obtain permits, licenses or authorizations to conduct waste management activities. Most
important is the incorporation of these general rules into national legislation, and their practical
implementation to ensure ESM. Only when adequate waste management practices are promoted can
the necessary investments be made by facilities and other stakeholders to bring about environmentally
sound waste management practices. Therefore, it is of the greatest importance to enable the main
actors to access the necessary information: this manual provides an overview of the necessary
information with some references.
II. Permits, licenses or authorization procedures
3. Waste management activities, sites and facilities should hold a permit, license, or other
authorization (e.g. information provision, registration, as appropriate).
4. National, regional, or state legislation should clearly state the process by which facilities can
obtain a permit, license or other authorization and the designated authorities to contact.
5. Waste management facilities may only operate if the operator holds a permit, license, or other
authorization containing requirements and conditions and is in compliance with these requirements for
the protection of the environment, as well as to avoid adverse effect on human health. Waste
management facilities should adhere to provisions regarding the waste management hierarchy
(prevention, minimization, reuse, recycling, other recovery including energy recovery and final
disposal), transportation, storage, accident prevention, site clean-up, and any other matters as specified
in the permit, license or authorization.
6. Because of the connection between different permits, licenses or authorizations (e.g. for
buildings, water discharge, or environmental protection in general), such procedures should be fully
coordinated, and start with preliminary discussions with the operator before commencing the “official”
permitting, licensing or authorization procedure according to legislation.
7. Costs for the application and approval procedure and monitoring by designated authorities can
be covered by a fee payable by the operators of the permitted, licensed or authorized activity.
A. Planning
8. Ideally, the first stage of the permitting, licensing or authorization process begins with
planning as follows:
(a) Designated authorities should be subjected to an obligation to develop a strategy and
plan of the national/regional/local waste management infrastructure according to the needs of
capacities (waste management plan) and in the course of spatial planning (including land use, urban,
regional, transport and environmental planning, etc.).1 This plan should be updated regularly, taking
into account the evolution of the amounts and types of waste generated, the availability of waste
management technologies, the implemented legislation and other policy related measures;
(b) The operators of waste management facilities and services should plan their activities
prior to applying for a permit, license or authorization;
(c) The designated authority should be informed by the operator at a very early stage of its
planning activities to ensure a timely and efficient permitting, licensing or authorization procedure;
(d) The designated authority should make an assessment of appropriate action to be taken
in case of non-compliance of a facility’s operations.
B. Application
9. The permit, license or authorization should be issued to legal person(s) registered within the
provisions of the relevant national, regional, or state legislation;
1 Proper positioning and planning of the facility should be assessed by superimposing the spatial location on other
maps such as road, rail, water supply, residences, community services, etc.
UNEP/CHW.13/4/Add.1
23
10. The person(s) applying for a permit, license or authorization should submit an application
including the following:
(a) Name of the company, registered office, management address;
(b) Location of the planned waste management site or facility/service;
(c) Type (e.g. Basel code and name), quantity and origin of waste to be accepted and
managed;
(d) Type of waste management activities/operations for which the application is submitted;
(e) Methods and technologies that will be applied (BAT/BEP should be considered, as
appropriate);
(f) Downstream waste management of residual wastes;
(g) Maximum capacity of the installations;
(h) The proposed technology and other techniques for preventing or, where this is not
possible, reducing discharges/emissions/releases from the installation into each medium
(air/soil/water);
(i) Indication of discharges/emissions/releases and resulting waste streams (type,
description, quantities and destinations) to be expected;
(j) Measures planned to monitor discharges/emissions/releases into the environment;
(k) Safety and precautionary measures that will be taken as appropriate (and specification
as to what these measures would address);
(l) Specific competencies and skills of employees;
(m) Measures and technologies for closure and after-care operations at waste management
sites; 2
(n) Adequate and appropriate contingency 3 and emergency plans;
(o) A report of an environmental impact assessment (EIA), if required;
(p) A detailed waste management plan, if required, including a description of:
(i) The waste management operation(s) or service(s) that will be carried out,
including how wastes will be stored;
(ii) Sufficient measures to safeguard occupational safety and health (OSH);
(iii) (Appropriate and adequate) contingency and emergency plans;
(iv) Training programme for personnel;
(v) Monitoring and reporting programme;
(vi) Plan for closure and after-care;
(vii) Financial insurance or guarantees for liabilities resulting from accidents,
emergency spills, environmental damages and/or clean-up, closure and after-
care;
(viii) Other information according to the requirements of national, regional or state
legislation.
11. The application should be submitted to the designated authority in the appropriate format
according to the national, regional or state legislation.
2 The need for closure plans and financial insurance or guarantees is determined by applicable laws and
regulations, taking into consideration the level of risk. Closure plans should be updated periodically and financial
insurance or guarantees should ensure that necessary measures are undertaken upon cessation of activities to
prevent any environmental damage and to return the site of operation to a satisfactory state, as required by the
applicable laws and regulations.
3 For example, appropriate action to be taken in case of exceeding emission limits arising from the facility’s
operations.
UNEP/CHW.13/4/Add.1
24
C. Approval process
12. The designated authority should, among other things:
(a) Set time limits for each stage of the application and approvals procedure. Time limits
will lead to reduced costs for applicants and ensure designated authorities are accountable and
efficient;
(b) Decide whether the application and its accompanying documentation complies with
regulatory requirements, including the environmental impact assessment (EIA) and an assessment of
the implementation of BAT/BEP, if required by national, regional or state legislation;
(c) Inspect the site and discuss details with the applying person(s);
(d) Consult with other relevant authorities, and the public, if required, in order to gather
facts and opinions that would contribute to the assessment of the application;
(e) If necessary ask the applicant to provide additional relevant information and/or
undertake actions in order to comply with national, regional or state legislation to issue the permit,
license or authorization for the particular waste management activity;
(f) Issue or refuse to issue the permit, license or authorization in accordance with national,
regional or state requirements;
(g) If appropriate, lay down specific conditions for carrying out waste-related operations;
(h) Have a process in place to involve the public for example through public meetings,
public review and commenting periods on the application for a permit, license or authorization.
D. Change/cancellation/termination of permits, licenses or authorizations
13. A permit, license or authorization can be changed, cancelled or terminated as follows:
(a) It can be amended or supplemented as deemed necessary by the designated authority;
(b) It can be amended or supplemented upon request of the permit, license or authorization
holder;
(c) The operator should inform the designated authority of any planned change in the
nature or functioning, or an extension of the installation that may have consequences for the
environment. Where appropriate, the designated authority should update the permit, license or
authorization;
(d) Substantial changes of an installation, waste management facility or service, should
result in prior updating of the permit, license or authorization. In this case the operator should apply
for an amendment to the permit, license or authorization;
(e) The permitted, licensed or authorized operations should be terminated, for example:
(i) After the expiration date of the permit, license or authorization (if no renewal is
sought);
(ii) If violations are not addressed;
(iii) If the permit, license or authorization holder requests a termination.
III. Requirements
14. This section provides examples of requirements that are generally addressed with respect to the
ESM of waste. Many countries take different approaches to establishing requirements in order to
determine what may constitute ESM of waste.
UNEP/CHW.13/4/Add.1
25
A. Environmental requirements
15. Environmental requirements may include the following:
(a) Air emissions from thermal processing:
(i) Thresholds for: CO2, SOx , NOx , fine dust, HCl, HF, dioxins and furans, gaseous
and vaporous organic substances, expressed as total organic carbon (TOC), and
heavy metals such as mercury, lead, arsenic, chromium;
Note: Dioxins are produced in small concentrations when organic material is
burned in the presence of chlorine. Furans are also usually produced from
thermal processes.
(ii) Quantities and maximum concentration of contaminants in the ashes;
(b) Waste water:
(i) Categorizing of discharged water/fluids and receiving medium (water body,
sewer, water treatment plant);
(ii) Thresholds for: Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand
(COD), mercury, cadmium, arsenic, lead, chromium, copper, nickel, zinc,
cobalt;
(iii) Conditions for waste water from flue gas cleaning;
(iv) Thresholds of contaminants in the discharges/effluent (from waste water
treatment) and in the ashes and slags (from thermal treatment) for final disposal;
(c) Other (odour, light, noise etc.):
Requirements for minimum standards of odour, light and noise;
(d) Landfill sites:
Quantities and concentration of contaminants in the ashes and slag due for final
disposal in landfill.
B. Occupational safety and health requirements
16. Occupational safety and health (OSH) requirements may include the following:
(a) Hygiene and nuisance control;
(b) Sufficient measures to safeguard OSH:
Workers at waste management facilities or services should not be exposed to
unacceptable OSH risks related to the content of the materials they are handling or
discharges/emissions/releases from those materials and the equipment being used. The
waste may include hazardous chemicals or toxic metals; it may generate
discharges/emissions or release harmful dust. Workers may have to handle heavy
loads, and be exposed to vibrations and the noise of machinery. Also, the risk of fire
and explosion may exist in some cases. Consequently, adequate measures should be
taken to avoid unacceptable OSH risks. Adequate measures should be established by
national, regional or state legislation, in the authorization of facilities or by voluntary
agreements;
(c) Facilitate periodic medical examination for employees;
(d) Facilitate periodic training of employees of waste facilities:
Personnel involved in the management of waste and materials, in particular hazardous
waste and materials, should be capable and adequately trained to identify and properly
handle the materials, operate equipment and follow processes, eliminate risk situations,
control releases and carry out safety and emergency procedures;
(e) Sufficient measures to ensure that children are not present within the grounds of the
waste facility;
(f) Auditing committees should be established for different OSH and environmental
issues.
UNEP/CHW.13/4/Add.1
26
17. In addition, the operators of the waste management facility should ensure protection of the
communities surrounding the hazardous waste facility from air pollutants, wastewater discharges,
groundwater pollution, noise, etc. during operation of the facility. There should also be a well-
maintained follow-up programme by the designated authority as ensuring the health and safety of
surrounding communities is often not part of the direct legal obligations of the owner or operator of
the waste facility. Measures should be taken to prevent access by children to hazardous areas of a
waste facility both during active operation and following closure of the facility.
IV. Monitoring and control
18. The facility should have a regularly updated plan for monitoring, reporting and responding to
accidental or otherwise exceptional discharges/emissions/releases.
A. Monitoring
19. The facility should have standardized sampling and testing methods in order to facilitate the
monitoring of its operations.
20. The facility should have a monitoring and reporting programme that covers:
(a) Relevant legal requirements;
(b) Compliance with applicable safety requirements;
(c) Groundwater quality, discharges and emissions, as well as other requirements
established (relating to soil, noise, odour, etc.);
(d) Incoming, stored and outgoing waste, in particular for hazardous waste;
(e) Type and amount of wastes disposed of and disposal methods employed;
(f) Record keeping for a specified time.
B. Appropriate and adequate emergency plan
21. This plan should include emergencies such as accidents, fires, explosions, abnormal operating
conditions, etc. The emergency plan should be based on the evaluation of existing and potential risks.
This plan should be regularly tested and revised as appropriate, in particular after the occurrence of
accidents or emergency situations.
C. Records and reports
22. There should be an obligation to provide information and reports which cover the requirements
listed in section A on monitoring above: waste management facilities and services should maintain
records on the generation, collection, transport or disposal of waste, its type and amounts. These
records are to be made available to the designated authorities upon request for a specified time period.
D. Control
23. On a periodic basis, in accordance with national, regional or state legislation, designated
authorities should inspect the facility(ies) or services for which the permit, license or authorization has
been issued to verify compliance of the conditions for waste management with those stated in the
permit, license or authorization issued and compliance with the requirements of the legislation.
24. Follow-up actions in case of non-compliance should be developed and documented. For
example, measures that may be taken include the issuance of fines, temporary closure and other
judicial and administrative penalties.

This report has been drawn up to provide
interested parties with information on the key results
of functioning of the compliance control system at
the International Investment Bank in 2017.
The report sums up the results of the compliance
control activities and provides description of its
performance in terms of identification, monitoring,
and control of compliance risks assumed by the
Bank.
Transparency and integrity are the key principles for
the Bank when disclosing information on the state of
assumed compliance risks.
The IIB determines the following as compliance risks:
“the risks of legal or regulatory sanctions, financial
loss, or loss to reputation that a bank may suffer as a
result of its failure to comply with all applicable laws,
regulations, codes of conduct and standards of good
practice”.
The Bank sees external and internal policies,
regulations and other regulatory documents along
with decisions by the Bank’s managing bodies on the
INTRODUCTION
Publication of this report is implied by the
commitments made by the IIB to observe
the principles and standards stipulated

PREVENTING AND COMBATING FRAUD
AND CORRUPTION, which the Bank
joined by correspondence in 2015.

issues related to corporate ethics, managing conflicts
of interest, combating money-laundering and
financing terrorism, preventing corruptive and
fraudulent activities by both counterparties and the
Bank’s personnel as key compliance rules.
The division responsible for implementation of
compliance policies and requirements approved by
the management of the Bank is the Compliance
Department (CD). Identification, assessment, and
control of compliance risks are carried out across all
areas of Bank’s activities: both as part of building
internal relations at the personnel and divisions level
and when working with counterparties in the course
of making transactions with them. The CD
systematically evaluates risks as part of a regular
self-assessment of compliance risks and analysis of
certain workstreams, transactions, initiatives, and
counterparties, as well as after changes in the
external or internal environment have occurred.
In 2017, the Bank’s external conditions were
characterized by the increased complexity of the
regulatory environment and the emergence of new
compliance-related initiatives. Such changes became
an additional load for the Bank’s divisions
responsible for identification of emerging risks and
responding to them.
In order to timely reveal and assess compliance risks,
the Bank closely monitors changes in the
international environment and in the territories of its
presence, as well as those occurring with its key
partners and counterparties.
This makes it possible to promptly respond to such
changes and take measures to mitigate their
potential negative impact on the Bank. In such work
special importance is attached to aligning the
activities with other international development
institutions and taking a common stand in response
to the changing conditions of doing business.
In particular, 2017 was characterized by a burst of
anticorruption investigations on the IIB’s markets of
presence. This prompted the Bank to update its
internal procedures aimed at reinforcing the work
and analysis of borrowers’ relations with public
sector and their dependence upon decisions taken
by the authorities.
2017 saw an overall reduction in the number and
amount of penalties imposed by certain jurisdictions
due to the exposed violations against restrictive
economic and political sanctions. On the other
hand, the requirements of certain jurisdictions for
the application of such measures and new
unconventional restrictive instruments issued by
them significantly complicated the work of
compliance divisions on the international markets.
In 2017, an additional expert assessment of newly
introduced restrictive measures was required to
ensure their correct interpretation followed by the
updates in internal policies, accounting systems, and
contracts with counterparties.
Significant growth of national and international
efforts in combating money laundering.
The legislation in certain member states
underwent significant changes aimed at bringing
them closer to international standards. International
community and world’s leading countries
increasingly call for aligning efforts in combating tax
avoidance. And their voices are getting louder. The
issues of international tax relations are becoming
more and more critical, when structuring and
implementing projects in several jurisdictions.
Following such developments, 2017 saw the
emergence of new areas in compliance control
function, whereas some of its traditional elements
were reinforced with additional expert assessments
and requirements. Close monitoring of changes in
the external environment and their timely
assessment make it possible to maintain the Bank’s
compliance risk profile at the level acceptable for the
shareholders and ensure secure business operations
aimed at meeting the goals approved by the member
states.
IN 2017, THE BANK’S EXTER-
NAL CONDITIONS WERE
CHARACTERIZED BY
INCREASED COMPLEXITY
OF THE REGULATORY
ENVIRONMENT.

THE KEY FUNCTIONS OF THE
CD INCLUDE:
The key objective of the Department is to take
measures for identification, assessment, prevention,
and control of compliance risks arising in the Bank’s
activities.
Department’s key functions are described in
the Regulations on Compliance Control of the IIB.
The work of the Department is aimed at
establishing a compliance control system within
the Bank in accordance with the corresponding
international standards and the best practices in
this area.
CORE ACTIVITIES
The Department pays special attention to
experience gained by international organizations
and development banks, including those
participated by the IIB member states.
When developing the compliance control system
the Department strives to maintain a high level of
efficiency and be business-oriented and proactive in
managing risks taken by the division with due,
consideration of the large-scale strategic goals of
the IIB related to fulfilling its mission of an
international financial institution.
The daily operations involve providing
consultations and opinions of the Department on
issues under consideration (agreeing draft regulatory
documents, agreements, and questionnaires,
analyzing and assessing risks associated with the
Bank’s projects, personnel management, etc.). The
main divisions and collegiate bodies that are CD’s
internal clients include the Credit Committee, the
Procurement Committee, the Credit and Investment
Block, and Structured and Debt Finance
Department.
The CD’s expert opinion is reviewed and taken
into consideration when making decisions by the
Financial Committee and the Board.
Representatives of the CD are members of a
number of the Bank’s collegiate bodies, closely
cooperate with expert divisions, have access to
Board meetings and report regularly to the
Chairman of the Board of the.

COMBATING MONEY LAUNDERING,
FRAUD, AND CORRUPTION
One of CD’s key objectives is the identification
and assessment of compliance risks associated with
the Bank’s potential and current counterparties. Its
key principles and regulation are established in the
Policy for Combating Money Laundering, Fraud, and
Corruption and the corresponding internal
regulations. The key tool for identification and
assessment of compliance risks is Know Your
Customer (KYC) procedure.
In 2017, the CD performed initial KYC assessment
of projects, new counterparties being financial
organizations, and counterparties in non-core
activities of the Bank. Additionally, all the Bank’s
counterparties were assessed and monitored against
compliance risk.
As part of support of the trade financing activities
the CD arranged checks on 81 prospective deals (for
each on the financing bank, the issuer, the exporter,
the importer as well as checks of the submitted
documents for the risks of fraud, sanctions, and
money laundering).
To identify and assess compliance risks associated
with counterparties the CD uses both publicly
available sources of information and commercial
databases. The CD has access to databases of the
leading providers of vetting services.
These tools made it possible to provide the CD
with required information to the maximum extent
and had a positive impact on the quality of opinions
prepared.
In 2017, the CD carried out activities to combat
fraud and corruption both inside the Bank and in
operations with counterparties. Cases of identified
fraud and corruption risks were reported to the
management and the Chairman of the Board.
However, none of the suspicions of fraud/corruption
investigated by the CD was confirmed. The checks
performed by the CD in 2017 did not reveal any real
facts of fraud or corruption or Bank’s involvement in
such activities.
In 2017, the CD updated the Regulations on
Measures for Combating Money Laundering,
Financing Terrorism, Fraud, and Corruption. The
regulations were updated taking into consideration
practices and experience obtained in professional
discussions with other development institutions.
The CD conducted a comparative analysis of the
compliance control requirements in various
Since 2017, the CD has been arranging
a compliance check on the auditors
of financial reports of IIB’s potential
borrowers.
In 2017, the CD gained access
to credit bureaus in a number of
member states and corporate registers
and commercial databases containing
extended information on legal entities
and individuals being residents of the
member states.
development banks and based on the findings
developed proposals to improve the IIB’s procedures.
Thus, the CD was included in the list of divisions that
monthly monitor the loan portfolio and a monitoring
form was developed. Counterparty compliance
questionnaires under KYC procedure were adjusted
with a special emphasis on control via funds and
offshore jurisdictions and the disclosure of detailed
biographies of owners and key management.
New reporting forms for client relations managers
were also introduced to enhance their involvement
in identification of potential compliance risks
associated with counterparties. The CD opinion
form was adjusted to include a section on
beneficiary’s biography, improve the opinion
structure, and introduce a special appendix
describing the KYC results in a more structured way.
In view of the IIB’s strategy to enter new
non-traditional markets of presence, mostly through
trade financing products, the CD initiated a project
aimed at the preliminary assessment of jurisdictions’
compliance risks. Such assessment will make it
possible to provide the management bodies with
additional information on the maturity and safety of
new markets to be entered by the IIB to assist in
further justified and informed decision-making.
The Bank’s position on restrictive measures is that all
its operations shall fully comply with the established
restrictions (where applicable) at both international
and national levels. In 2017, the Bank’s activities did

not violate any of the restrictive measures or
embargoes monitored by the IIB.
Noteworthy is the CD’s initiative to explore the
requirements of national and international regulators
for politically exposed persons (PEPs) to which a
number of the Bank’s executives belong. The
necessary information on the banks’ requirements
for public officials in the country of IIB’s residence
was communicated to the interested employees of
the Bank.
7
CODE OF ETHICS
The IIB attaches close attention to staff discipline
and prevention of conflicts of interest. For this
purpose, the Bank has developed and applies the
Code of Ethics and the Regulations on Management
of Conflicts of Interest. The CD holds regular
consultations with employees on the application of
the above documents and on how to resolve
occurring situations. In order to prevent a conflict of
interest the CD collects filled in questionnaires on
conflicts of interest from all new employees and
regularly collects and analyses the filled in
questionnaires on conflicts of interest from all current
employees.
In total, the CD reviewed 10 important situations,
which could result in a conflict of interest in 2017.
For each case, required measures were developed
and applied to avoid the conflict of interest. As yet,
the identified cases and risks of a conflict of interest
have not given rise to any significant negative
results.
An employee is responsible for informing their
manager and the CD of any suspicions and facts of
any prohibited practices in the Bank as well as any
situations which may result in a conflict of interest.
Information on violations in the IIB or in the
projects to which the Bank is a participant can be
received through several communication
channels: via the Intranet, by mail or email
(compliance@iibbank.com), through the electronic
form on the IIB’s website (www.iib.int). Full
anonymity is guaranteed to all the whistleblowers.
In 2017, the IIB received only one message meeting
the criteria set for review. Investigation of the
message took place in 2018.
In accordance with the Procedure for Receiving and
Presenting Gifts, in 2017 the CD took measures
aimed at practical implementation of this document
by way of corresponding reminders to the Bank’s
employees.
In 2017, 14 messages on presenting approved gifts
to the Bank’s partners were registered. The CD
received 2 messages from Bank’s employees about
getting gifts and in each case the gift value did not
exceed EUR 100. In accordance with the Bank’s
policies regarding gifts, these were retained by
those, who received them.
As the IIB issues securities traded on stock
exchanges, the CD identifies insiders and processes
information received from them. In total, as of the
end of 2017, about 120 insiders were registered in
the Bank, including both individuals and legal
entities. Such persons are being monitored for
compliance with the insider criteria. The CD informs
them of inclusion in the insider list.
During 2017, by the assistance from
interested divisions and the top
management, the CD took part in
resolving the cases, which could result
in the violation of the Code’s
provisions.
The following case can be used as an example
of reviewing a situation related to a conflict of
interest. In 2017, an IIB employee responsible
for attraction and disbursing loans to clients
approached the CD with an information that a
substantial amount of money was credited to
their personal account. Shortly after that, a
loan application initiated by this employee was
to be reviewed by the Credit Committee.
Based on the results of the actions taken and
the evaluation of the situation, the CD was
informed by the bank, which had credited the
funds that the operation had been made by
mistake, for the money had been intended for
another person from another international
financial organization. The money was
returned to the sender.

TRAININGS AND PERSONNEL DEVELOPMENT
The CD arranges face-to-face training on
compliance control for all new employees of the
Bank and organizes annual trainings to update the
knowledge of compliance risks.
As part of the trainings on combating money
laundering, financing terrorism, corruption, and
fraud the CD informs the Bank employees of the
recent trends globally and in the IIB member states
as well as the measures to be taken for prevention of
corruption and fraud. For this purpose, in 2017, the
CD updated the presentations on combating fraud
and corruption and forwarded them to the
personnel for studying.
In 2017, a specialist company providing online
training and testing services was engaged for regular
personnel training. Ninety-eight percent of the
trained employees successfully passed the testing.
Fifteen employees left the Bank in 2017, the CD
held exit interviews with 13 of them. No compliance
risks were revealed based on the results of the
interviews.
Additionally, the CD consulted a number of
employees dismissed/transferred by the Bank on the
observance of their right in connection with the
regulations and the values of the Bank in accordance
with the Code of Corporate Ethics. In 2017, the Bank
hired 14 employees whose functional duties are
related to compliance risks. For such employees the
CD held trainings on compliance.
In 2017, the CD surveyed the divisions for their
satisfaction with the services provided by the Bank’s
compliance function. All the employees interacting
with the CD took part in the survey. Mostly positive
responses were received regarding the quality of the
services, the timing, the availability of materials, and
the general development level of the Bank’s
compliance system. Based on the received feedback,
the CD revised the internal content of the Bank’s
portal where all the key documents and explanations
regarding the compliance requirements, which
employees need for their daily work, are placed in a
structured way.

AUTOMATION
OF COMPLIANCE PROCESSES
The key functions of the IIB’s automated
compliance system were successfully
implemented in 2017. The system is fully
operable and meets CD’s needs in terms of
systematization, processing, and control of
requests for KYC. This made it possible to fully
switch to electronic documentation, improve
stability and integrity of the work with
counterparties and substantially reduce the
resources for data processing and primary
analysis. All the Bank’s counterparties along
with the basic information on them are entered
into the system. The checks for their presence
in the lists of undesirable persons and persons
with increased compliance risks are conducted
regularly. Counterparties are constantly
monitored for the need to update the
information entered on them and their
assigned risk group.
PROCUREMENT
The CD mandatorily arranges the CD procedure
with regard to all the potential suppliers of goods,
works, and services for the Bank. In 2017, the CD
initiated implementation of a number of procedures
in the procurement activities aimed at improvement
of transparency of the Bank’s own procurement.
For example, common email boxes were arranged
with access for all the members of the Procurement
Committee to be mandatorily used for all the
correspondence of the business divisions with their
potential suppliers.
The key principles and requirements to the
materials for review of draft CAPEX estimates were
developed to increase transparency and justifiability
of the requested investments, the procedure for
conducting typical works and emergency works was
improved.
An important stage in developing internal
compliance reporting system was the completion of
the project to establish a corporate data warehouse.
This tool makes it possible to obtain live data and
supply the Bank’s management with up-to-date
information on the state of compliance risks.
Necessary preventive measures may be taken based
on the results of such analysis. Currently, reporting
on compliance risks is generated automatically
based on the set parameters and data processing
algorithms.
In order to prevent internal fraud the CD initiated
a number of adjustments in the Bank’s payment
modules for their integration with the compliance
control system. Currently, none of the Bank’s
payments (in excess of the set limit of EUR 3,000)
can be made without registration and confirmation
of the counterparty in the accounting system.

INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION
In 2017, the CD continued participation in
international cooperation on compliance and
activities aimed at propagation of best compliance
practices both inside the Bank and in the external
environment.
In the reporting year, CD representatives took
part in compliance activities arranged by the leading
service providers. In 2017, the CD continued
developing and broadening contacts with
representatives of international financial
organizations’ compliance divisions. Bank’s
representatives took part in the Private Sector
Integrity Meeting, a work meeting of international
financial organizations’ compliance divisions.
Signing a Memorandum of Cooperation in the
Field of Compliance with the EDB became an
important step. According to the document,
An important initiative for the bank and a great
success on the global stage of professional
compliance events was arrangement of the
Compliance Challenges for Development
Financial Institutions conference in Bratislava in
December 2017. Compliance officers of both
international development banks and national
development institutions took part in the event.
Prospects and issues of compliance control
development in the IIB countries and globally
were discussed at the conference.
It should be mentioned that the first project
with the Technical Assistance Fund established by
the IIB and the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak
Republic was a project in Mongolia aimed at
improving the law on combating money
laundering and financing terrorism. Selected
consultants will provide assistance to the
regulator of the Mongolian financial market in
bringing the national law into compliance with
the international standards.
The Bank intends to continue developing its
compliance function with a focus on practical
actions implemented with the involvement of
partners and other development institutions.
information exchange on joint investment projects,
sharing experience in use of compliance tools, and
arrangement of joint training activities are planned
between the banks. Practical implementation of this
Memorandum is planned for 2018.
Signing the Memorandum of Understanding in
the field of compliance control between the IIB
and the EDB, December 2017.
Compliance Challenges for Development
Financial Institutions conference,
December 2017.
THANK YOU!
In conclusion, the CD would like to extend their
gratitude to all the divisions and the top management
of the Bank for their active involvement in the
development and support of the IIB’s compliance
control system in 2017.

this _________day of ________________, 20 , by and between the Jasper Municipal
Utilities (“Utility”), and , (“Customer”). Utility and
Customer are hereinafter sometimes referred to individually as “Party” or collectively as “Parties”.
WITNESSETH:
WHEREAS, Customer is installing, or has installed, solar, wind, biomass, geothermal,
hydroelectric, or other renewable generation equipment, controls, and protective relays and
equipment (“Generation Facilities”) used to interconnect and operate in parallel with Utility’s
electric system, which Generation Facilities are more fully described in Exhibit A, attached hereto
and incorporated herein by this Agreement, and as follows:
Location:

Generator Size and Type: ; and
WHEREAS, the name plate rating of the Generation Facilities exceeds 10kW.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration thereof, Customer and Utility agree as follows:
1. Application. It is understood and agreed that this Agreement applies only to the operation of
the Generation Facilities described above and on Exhibit A.
2. Interconnection. Utility agrees to allow Customer to interconnect and operate the Generation
Facilities in parallel with Utility’s electric system in accordance with any operating procedures
or other conditions specified in the Application for Interconnection of Self Generation
Facilities, incorporated by reference and attached hereto as Exhibit A. By this Agreement, or
by inspection, if any, or by non-rejection, or by approval, or in any other way, Utility does not
give any warranty, express or implied, as to the adequacy, safety, compliance with applicable
codes or requirements, or as to any other characteristics of the Generation Facilities. The
Generation Facilities installed and operated by or for Customer shall comply with, and
Customer represents and warrants their compliance with: (a) the National Electrical Code and
the National Electrical Safety Code, as each may be revised from time to time; (b) Utility's
rules and regulations and Utility's General Terms and Conditions for Electric Service, each as

property on customer’s premises. Customer acknowledges that from time to time it may be
necessary or desirable that electric service be temporarily interrupted for maintenance,
construction, repairs, emergencies, other purposes, or failure of the City’s suppliers to deliver
power. During such periods, the Electric Utility assumes no responsibility and shall not be
liable for any resulting loss which might be affected by the fact that electric service is
interrupted for a period of time.
5. Liability for Damages. The Electric Utility shall not be liable for damages in case electric
supply should be interrupted or fail by reason of a natural disaster, vandalism, accident, labor
dispute or civil disorder. Further, the Electric Utility shall not be liable for damages in case

reasonable control, including necessary repairs, breakdowns or damage to sub-station
equipment, transmission lines, distribution lines, generating facilities or other facilities of the
Electric Utility.
a. Unless otherwise provided in a contract between the Electric Utility and the customer, the
point at which service is delivered by the Electric Utility to the customer (delivery point)
shall be the point at which the customer’s meter base and entrance conductor is connected
to the Electric Utility’s facilities. The Electric Utility shall not be liable for any loss, injury,
or damage resulting from the customer’s use of his equipment or occasioned by the energy
furnished by the Electric Utility beyond the delivery point.
b. The customer shall provide and maintain suitable protective devices on his equipment to
prevent any loss, injury or damage resulting from a single phasing condition or any other

These delays not only suppress innovation and growth but also create uncertainty in the renewable
investment climate. When developers lack a clear, predictable permitting timeline, it becomes difficult
to plan for production and resource allocation, leading to inefficiencies. Without the certainty of a
streamlined process, attracting investment into large-scale renewable projects, such as offshore wind
farms, becomes more challengingii.
1.2 Rationale
An efficient and effective permitting process is crucial for accelerating the deployment of renewable
energy projects. Streamlined permitting can significantly reduce the lead time for projects, which is
essential for meeting global energy transition goals. When the process is unpredictable, discretionary,
or inconsistent, developers face delays, which can ultimately disincentivize investment.
Currently, the permitting process for many renewable energy projects is a highly manual and
fragmented system. It involves numerous stakeholders, ranging from national governments, local
governments and state agencies to public interest groups, each of which has input into whether a
project can proceed or not. This decentralized yet under-resourced system results in disorganized
decision-making and permits getting stuck in bureaucratic delays. Moreover, the lack of digital tools
aggravates inefficiencies, slowing down approval times even further.
For large-scale renewable projects like offshore wind farms, permitting delays can last several years,
negatively affecting industry momentum. Without the certainty of a defined project pipeline and a
predictable timeline, the renewable energy industry struggles to build at scale. Therefore, a
streamlined approach to permitting is necessary to provide certainty to investors, enhance efficiency
in the development of renewable energy projects, and ultimately help accelerate the clean energy
transition.
The Figure 6 below outlines the importance of a good permitting process summarized in 7 key areas.

Without proper permitting, renewable energy projects can face significant obstacles, such as legal
challenges, opposition from local communities, or failure to meet regulatory requirements. Thus, a
well-structured, transparent, and predictable permitting process is crucial for the successful and
timely implementation of renewable energy initiatives.
Broadly speaking, an effective permitting system provides clarity to investors and other players in
terms of expectations for legal and regulatory compliance, risk management and conflict resolution.
In addition to clarity of timelines, this includes stipulations for permits that are aligned with existing
land use policies, planning regulations, energy policies and other legal frameworks within the specific
subnational or country jurisdiction. Derived from alignment with existing policies, typical milestones in
a permitting process are illustrated by the Figure 7 below.
Attracting Investment
A clear and predictable permitting framework
gives investors’ confidence that renewable
energy projects will proceed without
unnecessary regulatory hurdles. This is
particularly important in attracting
international investment, as it reduces
perceived risks and uncertainty in project
execution.
Facilitating Timely Project Implementation
An efficient and effective permitting process is crucial for accelerating
the deployment of renewable energy projects. Streamlined
permitting can significantly reduce the lead time for projects, which is
essential for meeting global energy transition goals by ensuring
smooth implementation of energy projects. When the process is
unpredictable, discretionary, or inconsistent, developers face delays,
which can ultimately disincentivize investment
Encouraging Stakeholder Engagement
A transparent and inclusive permitting process
ensures that all stakeholders, including local
communities, government agencies, and other
stakeholders have a voice in the project
development.
This reduces opposition and builds trust
between developers and communities, leading
to smoother project implementation.
Supporting Long-term
Sustainability
and Energy Goals
By ensuring that projects meet
environmental, social, and legal
standards, a good permitting
process supports broader sub-
national, national and global goals
for sustainability, energy transition,
and climate change mitigation. It
ensures that renewable energy
projects contribute positively to
long-term energy security and
environmental protection.
Promoting Environmental
Sustainability
A well-structured permitting process
includes rigorous environmental
assessments, ensuring that projects
do not harm ecosystems, wildlife, or
natural resources thereby balancing
development with sustainability.
Ensuring Legal and Regulatory Compliance
A robust permitting process ensures that
renewable energy projects align with national laws,
local regulations, and international standards. This
compliance is important as it helps in avoiding
legal challenges, ensuring smooth project
execution, and fostering investor confidence.
Permitting
Crosscutting: Mitigating Risks and Conflicts
Permitting processes help identify and address potential risks, including land rights disputes, environmental concerns, or community
opposition early in the project. By resolving these issues upfront, the process reduces the likelihood of costly delays or conflicts during
the later stages of the project.

Definition of sustainable energy projects
When we speak of sustainable energy, we refer to UNDP’s definition of energy solutions that
simultaneously address development issues related to economic growth and social equity
aligned with SDG 7 on ensuring access to affordable, reliable, modern, and sustainable
energy. Goal 7 target areas include universal access to energy, increase in renewable energy
share in the global energy mix and improvement in global energy efficiency. This is also in
line with the conventional definition of sustainability: energy that can meet the energy needs
of the present without compromising the resources and energy supply of the future.
Whilst closely related to renewable energy, RE refers to those types of energy that use non-
finite resources. Because of varying data sources, the two might appear interchangeably
within this document.
Sustainable energy projects as discussed in this document cover project infrastructure within
the projects’ areas of interest varying by technology type including the dams, wind turbines,
solar panels, storage infrastructure, etc, and the land on which they are situated. It also
covers transmission infrastructure which is related to the discussion on grid connectivity but
also has discrete permitting requirements in some jurisdictions.

Box 1: Definition of sustainable energy technologies
1.3 Legal And Regulatory Basis for Permitting
The governing of sustainable energy permitting from a legal and regulatory varies widely across
jurisdictions although it shares certain common elements. As with other types of developments, it is
typically built around national energy policies, environmental protection laws, land use regulations,
and international agreements, with the goal of facilitating clean energy growth while ensuring
environmental sustainability, grid stability, and community welfare. Although the specifics vary by
country, Table 1 provides a summary of the elements commonly seen in global regulatory frameworks
for sustainable energy further explained below.

Table 1: Legal and regulatory basis for permitting
Permitting and Licensing Requirements: Specific permits are often
needed at various stages of project development, including
environmental clearance, land use permits, building permits, grid
connection agreements, and operational licenses. Many countries are
working to streamline the permitting process to reduce delays, but it
remains a critical regulatory step.
Policy and regulation
International Agreements
and Standards
National Energy Policies
Environmental Legislation
Land Use and Zoning Regulations
Permitting
and Licensing Requirements
International Agreements and Standards: Many countries have not
only signed but also follow global standards and agreements, such as
the Paris Agreement on climate change, which commits nations to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase renewable energy
adoption. International financial institutions like the World Bank and the
International Finance Corporation (IFC) also set environmental and
social standards for projects that they finance, which often influence
renewable energy project development. The United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) also provides a framework for
international cooperation on climate initiatives. These agreements
significantly influence national policies and project development in the
renewable energy sector.
National Energy Policies: Governments typically set national energy
policies or strategies that outline goals for renewable energy
production, energy security, and carbon emissions reduction. These
policies often include targets for renewable energy capacity, tax
incentives, feed-in tariffs, or renewable energy auctions to attract
investment. For instance, Kenya's National Energy and Petroleum
Policy (2018) outlines ambitious renewable energy targets, while
India's National Electricity Policy emphasizes increasing the share of
renewables in the energy mix.
Environmental Legislation: Environmental regulations are a key part of
the renewable energy framework, requiring Strategic Impact
Assessments (SEAs), Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) or
similar studies to evaluate potential effects on ecosystems, wildlife,
water resources, and local communities. In India, the Environment
(Protection) Act, 1986, provides a legal framework for environmental
clearance of projects. Compliance with environmental laws is
mandatory for permitting and project approval.
Land Use and Zoning Regulations: Renewable energy projects,
particularly wind and solar, require extensive land. National or local
authorities typically regulate land use through zoning laws, land
acquisition processes, or land use plans that ensure projects are sited in
appropriate areas, minimizing conflict with agriculture, conservation, or
urban development. Brazil's Forest Code (Law No. 12.651/2012)
regulates land use and mandates environmental licensing for projects,
promoting sustainable land use while minimizing conflicts with
agriculture and conservation efforts.
15
Grid Access: Countries have regulations that often define how renewable energy
projects can connect to the existing national grid and participate in the electricity
market. These include rules on grid capacity, priority dispatch for renewable
energy, and mechanisms to sell surplus energy to the grid, such as feed in tariffs
or power purchase agreements (PPAs). Germany’s Renewable Energy Sources
Act (EEG), officially known as Erneuerbare Energien Gesetz, ensures priority
grid access for renewable energy producers, allowing them to feed
electricity into the grid and receive compensation through established
tariffs.iii
Incentives and Financial Mechanisms: To encourage investment in renewable
energy governments often provide financial incentives such as tax breaks,
subsidies, grants or through dedicated renewable energy zones. India's Solar
Park Scheme which establishes dedicated renewable energy zones that provide
solar developers with benefits like land access infrastructure support and fiscal
incentivesiv. Other policies like renewable energy credits (RECs) or carbon pricing
also create financial markets for green energy.
Social and Community Engagement Requirements: Regulatory frameworks
majorly emphasize community engagement and require developers to consult
with local communities, particularly when land rights are involved. The need for
Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) has and continues to be a standard
requirement, especially in projects that affect Indigenous or vulnerable
populations. The Indigenous Peoples’ Rights Act (IPRA) in the Philippines
mandates FPIC for projects impacting Indigenous lands, ensuring their voices are
heard in decision making processes v.
Health and Safety Standards: Countries have regulations that cover health and
safety protocols during the construction and operational phases of renewable
energy projects. These standards aim to protect workers and the public from
hazards associated with large scale energy infrastructure.
In emerging markets, regulatory frameworks for renewable energy development are still evolving, but
many nations are working with international financial institutions and donor organizations to develop
policies that promote sustainable energy investments. Countries should prioritize aligning local
regulations with global standards to foster a more effective and cohesive approach to renewable
energy development.

1.4 Brief Overview of Permit Types
Development of sustainable energy projects is subject to multiple layers of approvals, here divided
into pre-construction and post-construction phases each addressing a specific aspect of regulatory
compliance. They typically apply to different stages of project development, ensuring adherence to
environmental, technical, and legal standards. Depending on the jurisdiction which determines the
licensing convention applicable, permits fall into these broad categories: site selection, environmental
impact assessment, construction, and grid integration, ensuring comprehensive oversight throughout
the project lifecycle. Figure 8 illustrates key types of permits typically required for renewable energy
projects across the globe.
1.4.1 Pre-Construction Permits
These include all processes up until a building permit is issued.
Land Use/Siting and Zoning Approvals
These include zoning approvals as well as land ownership agreements.
Zoning/Change of Use Approval - This approval ensures that the land designated for the project is
appropriately zoned for energy infrastructure. For example, a project in the U.S. may require local
government approval for changes in land use, while in Europe, national guidelines often govern such
processes. On the hand a country like Denmark has streamlined processes allowing rapid approvals,
while Nigeria and Kenya face bureaucratic bottlenecks.
Figure 8: Permit types applicable to SE projects
17
Suggestion to improve processes:
Implement a centralized online application system to reduce paperwork and processing times.
Land Lease/Ownership Documentation - Land lease or ownership documentation must be in place for
energy projects. In cases where land is not owned by the developer, appropriate leasing or ownership
documentation must be in place, such as a land lease or a Right-of-Way agreement. Denmark’s quick
lease agreements contrast with lengthy processes in South Africa, which can delay project initiation.
Suggestion to improve processes:
Create standardized templates for land agreements to expedite negotiations and approvals.
Environmental Permits
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Approval - Most jurisdictions require a thorough environmental impact
assessment to understand the potential effects of the project. This is a significant step in countries like South Africa,
Kenya and India, where EIAs are mandatory to address potential impacts on ecosystems, wildlife, and air quality.
Denmark’s efficient EIA process contrasts with lengthy requirements in Brazil and parts of Africa, where delays can
significantly affect timelines.
Suggestion to improve processes:
Streamline the EIA process by allowing phased assessments and engaging stakeholders early.
18
Construction and Building Permits
Construction Permit - This permit allows the developer to commence building the energy infrastructure.
Most countries often require site-specific approvals, which include detailed assessments of building
plans and materials to ensure compliance with local building codes. In Kenya, a construction permits
typically issued within 3-6 months (and up to 10 months in reality) whilst some countries in the
developed world have cut this down to between 2 and 4 weeks.
Suggestion to improve processes:
Introduce a single-window clearance system to consolidate permits into one platform for faster approvals.
Roads Construction Approval – This is mostly in remote areas where a road development is needed for
project construction. Approval is necessary for road development related to project construction.
Denmark's rapid processes contrast with delays in rural areas of Kenya, where bureaucratic delays can
hinder development with road projects taking up to 12 months to approve in the latter contrasted with
one month in the former.
Suggestion to improve processes:
Utilize existing road networks to minimize the need for new approvals and simplify logistics.
Aviation and Military Approvals
Aviation/Military Clearance - This is especially relevant for wind energy projects; this permit ensures that
turbines or high structures don’t interfere with flight paths or military operations. Countries have
stringent requirements for proximity to aviation facilities which must be adhered to. Denmark's
(typically 1-2 months) integration with aviation authorities allows for quicker approvals, while parts of
India (typically 3-4 months) often see delays.
Suggestion to improve processes:
Engage with aviation authorities early in planning to clarify requirements and avoid delays.
Cultural and Archaeological Permits
Cultural & Archaeological Impact Assessment - This is important in areas with cultural heritage or
archaeological significance. Several African nations, such as Kenya and South Africa, require these
assessments to protect cultural sites during the development of energy projects, a developer should
ensure they obtain the permits from the relevant authorities. Integrated approaches are useful in
cutting down the prolonged review times witnessed in areas like Peru where for example, the
Chavimochic project took 8 months to complete the cultural assessment.
Suggestion to improve processes:
Develop standardized procedures for cultural assessments to streamline reviews.
Social and Community Licenses
Social Impact Assessment (SIA) Approval and Community Consent - Like many projects, renewable energy
projects require the social license to operate, ensuring the community's voice is considered, and
benefits are equitably shared. Denmark’s effective community engagement contrasts with inconsistent
practices in parts of Africa and India. To exemplify Denmark’s leadership in this, for example, the SIA for
the H2RES Hydrogen Project in took 3 months while a similar process for the Lake Turkana Wind Power
Project in Kenya took 8 months.
Suggestion to improve processes:
Establish clear guidelines for community engagement to ensure consistent involvement throughout the project
lifecycle.

targeted advertising, and optimized
services but never fully disclose its uses
to its users. Similarly, location-based
services enhance navigation and provide
recommendations but track users'
movements, compromising their privacy.
iv. Data driven innovation and economic
growth:
Protecting individual privacy
while fostering data driven innovation
can lead to the development of new
technologies and services that benefit
society as a whole.
Example: M-Pesa2 in Kenya, a
mobile money transfer service,
facilitated financial inclusion for
millions who lacked access to traditional
banking services by utilizing mobile
phone data and alternative credit scoring
methods allows previously excluded
individuals access to financial services
like loans and insurance. Similarly, the
UK Biobank3, a large-scale biomedical
database, facilitates research on various
diseases and contributes to
advancements in preventative care by
studying its population health database.
It is important to remember that these
advancements often rely on anonymized
or aggregated data to minimize privacy
risks.
v. Protection against Government
Surveillance:
Sometimes Government
surveillance threatens individual privacy
by undermining the principles of consent,
transparency, and proportionality. It can
create a chilling effect on free expression
and association, as individuals may fear
repercussions for expressing dissenting
opinions or engaging in activities that are
perfectly legal but perceived as
threatening by authorities.
Example: The revelations by
Edward Snowden in 2013 exposed the
U.S. National Security Agency's (NSA)
mass surveillance programs, such as
PRISM4, which collected data from major
tech companies, collected metadata on
millions of Verizon customers' phone
calls, highlighting the extent to which
Governments can track citizens'
communications without their
knowledge, raising concerns about global
privacy violations.

(C.) How Government Department’s
data is stored in India -
Government departments in India
typically utilize cloud storage services
offered by authorized private companies to
manage extensive data. Cloud computing
allows users to rent or utilize software,
storage, and servers as needed, eliminating
the necessity to invest in an entire system.
The Ministry of Electronics and Information
Technology (MEITY)5 has enlisted the
services of 11 private companies to deliver
cloud computing services to Government
departments. This approach empowers
Government entities to scale their IT
infrastructure based on demand, even for
short durations, facilitating the prompt
launch of online services. The cloud
computing guidelines adhere to the Megh-
Raj Policy (cloud policy), offering a
strategic framework for the government's
adoption of cloud services. The overarching
goal of the cloud policy is to materialize a
comprehensive vision of a Government
Cloud (GI Cloud) environment, accessible to
central and state Government’s line
departments, districts, and municipalities.
This initiative aims to expedite the
enhancement of ICT-enabled services across
Government entities.
(D.) Evolving Threats to Digital Privacy
in India: -
The digitalization wave in India has
been transformative, with technologies such
as Aadhaar, e-Governance, and digital
payment systems like UPI reshaping
Government operations. Government
organizations embrace digital
transformation to enhance public services,
streamline operations, and engage with
citizens. While digitization of various
Government services promising greater
efficiency, raise concerns about the security
and privacy of citizens' data misuse and
potential violation of privacy rights.
Here are some of the evolving threats to
digital privacy in India-
i. Cybersecurity Attacks & Data
Breaches and Leaks:
Cybersecurity attacks, including
phishing, ransomware, and malware, pose a
constant risk to individuals and
organizations. Attackers seek unauthorized
access to sensitive data for financial gain or
malicious purposes. Data breaches can lead
to identity theft, financial fraud, and the
exposure of personal information, causing
significant harm to individuals or
organization's reputation.
PursuIT
8
ii. E-commerce and Digital Payments
Risks:
The growth of e-commerce and digital
payments introduces risks such as payment
fraud, unauthorized access to financial
information, and breaches of online
platforms. Individuals may experience
financial loss, identity theft, and disruption
of online transactions.
iii. Data Localization Challenges:
Data localization requirements may
present challenges in ensuring secure
storage and management of data within
India, particularly for organizations with
complex data processing operations.
Compliance challenges may arise, and there
could be an increased risk of unauthorized
access to data during localization processes.
iv. Lack of Awareness:
Many individuals may lack awareness
of digital privacy risks, safe online
practices, and the importance of securing
personal information. Inadequate
awareness increases the likelihood of
falling victim to cyber threats, phishing
attacks, and other forms of digital
manipulation.
v. Emerging Technologies:
The adoption of emerging technologies
such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine
learning, and blockchain introduces new
privacy challenges, including algorithmic
bias and data manipulation. Improper use of
these technologies can exacerbate privacy
risks, leading to discrimination and loss of
control over personal information.
(E.) Balancing the Equation:
Navigating this complex landscape
requires a multi-pronged approach that
balances innovation with data protection.
Here are some key strategies:
i. Transparency and accountability:
Organizations must be transparent about
their data collection practices and
accountable to citizens for its use. This
includes clear privacy policies, robust
oversight mechanisms, and accessible
avenues for redress.
ii. Privacy by design:
Data protection principles should be
embedded into the design of new
technologies and processes, minimizing
data collection and ensuring secure
storage and access controls.
iii. Empowering individuals:
Citizens should have clear rights to
access, control, and delete their personal
data held by organizations. This
includes the right to object to automated
decision-making based on personal
data.
iv. Security by default:
Robust cybersecurity measures should
be implemented across all computerised
PursuIT
9
systems, with regular vulnerability
assessments and penetration testing.
v. Collaboration and knowledge
sharing:
Governments can learn from each other
and collaborate with private sector
experts to develop and implement
effective data protection practices.
Implementing these strategies
presents significant challenges.
Governments often face resource
constraints, complex legacy systems, and
competing priorities. Striking a balance
between security, efficiency, and user-
friendliness can be difficult. However,
several solutions are emerging:
a. Privacy-enhancing technologies
(PETs): Tools like homomorphic
encryption and secure multi-party
computation allow data analysis
without revealing individual
information.
b. Privacy-aware AI: This field seeks to
develop AI algorithms that are fair,
unbiased, and respect individual
privacy.
c. Data minimization: Collecting only
the data necessary for a specific
purpose and discarding it securely after
use can significantly reduce privacy
risks.
d. Strong data governance
frameworks: Implementing clear
policies and procedures for data
management can ensure consistent and
responsible data handling across
Government agencies.
(F.) The DPDP Act, 2023: -
In early August 2023, the Indian Parliament
passed the Digital Personal Data Protection
(DPDP) Act, 20236. The DPDP Act is
India's first data protection act, and it
establishes a framework for the processing
of personal data in India. The act applies to
data collected online or offline, and later
digitized.
(G.) Conclusion:
The evolving landscape of digital
privacy in Indian Government organizations
requires a nuanced and multifaceted
approach. As India strides forward on the
path of digital transformation, it is
imperative to navigate the delicate balance
between innovation and data protection.
Government entities must not only comply
with evolving regulatory frameworks but
also foster an ethical and responsible
approach to data usage. The journey toward
balancing innovation and data protection is
not a static one. It requires a dynamic,
PursuIT
10

Government organizations, regulatory
bodies, and citizens. In shaping a responsible
digital future, India has the opportunity to set
global standards for how technology can be
harnessed for progress while respecting the
fundamental right to privacy.

DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY- UTILITY TRADEOFF
By Sh. Rahul Kumar, Director (Training & Research), iCISA
The trajectory of development and socio-
economic empowerment in India increasingly
hinges on data-centric platforms. These
platforms, often rolled out on a population-
wide scale, revolve around key pillars such as
Aadhar for identity verification, UPI (Unified
Payment Interface) and DBT (Direct Benefits
Transfer), leveraging E Kuber for direct
transfers, etc. This trend is also seen, in the
charts below for some NER states where the
coverage of Aadhar has increased
significantly in last 5 years1.
1 Data from UIDAI 2018 and 2023, Chart self-generated. Assam not included as it
skewed the chart due to large population.
Shri Rahul Kumar is 2015 batch IA&AS officer. He graduated in Mathematics & Computer Science from Chennai Mathematical
Institute. Currently he is posted as Director (Training & Research) at iCISA, Noida.
The article examines the role of data-centric platforms in India's socio-economic development, focusing on initiatives like
Aadhar, UPI, and DBT. It discusses the data lifecycle and privacy concerns, highlighting the risks of integrating databases
and the limitations of traditional anonymization methods. The concept of differential privacy is presented as a robust
solution for balancing data utility and individual privacy, emphasizing the importance of legal frameworks like the Digital
Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.
(The saturation ratio in brackets is arrived by dividing Aadhar Assigned with the Population.)

Moreover, private entities across domains
have widely embraced the India Stack
platform, with its multifaceted technological
infrastructure. Consequently, citizens
navigate intricate data landscapes as they
interact with these systems and leave trail of
data. The data lifecycles—comprising
acquisition, processing, analysis,
visualization and storage —within these
platforms and databases exhibit varying
degrees of privacy and security safeguards.
(Union fund transfers to citizen over the decade)
While these data-driven platforms have ushered in unprecedented efficiency and accessibility,
they also raise critical concerns regarding privacy and security safeguards. The lifecycles of
personal data within these systems exhibit varying degrees of protection, necessitating a
delicate balance between facilitating societal empowerment and upholding individual privacy
rights.

Integration and Interpretation
There are now instances of governments,
private sector entities using analytical
methods, big data, machine learning and AI
to gain insights from data. This is sometimes
done by joining different datasets, and
integrating various sources of data to uncover
patterns, trends, and correlations that can
provide valuable insights into stakeholders'
behaviour, preferences, and needs. But any
endeavour to integrate databases runs the risk
of loss of privacy. The classical methods of
data anonymization and pseudonymization
for such circumstances, have now started to
raise concerns of risk.
In a classical research on privacy conducted
by Latanya Sweeney, a Harvard professor, in
1996 demonstrated the risk of data de-
anonymization, demonstrating that an
anonymized medical dataset that was in the
public domain, can be used to identify
individuals, regardless of the removal of all
explicit identifiers, when the medical dataset
was combined with a public voter list. (chart
above) Sweeney found that 87% of the US
population in a censorship dataset, could be
identified by combining data attributes which
are known as quasi2-identifiers3.

legislation in 1996 called HIPPA (Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
in USA.
To resolve this situation, the k- anonymity
algorithm was introduced by Sweeney in
1998.
identifiers are those which can indirectly but precisely
identify a person when mixed with attributes like Zip,
Birth Date etc)
Chart above shows the ability to analyze and cross-reference
demographic information from the combined medical and voter data
sources, enabling the re-identification of individuals based on specific
combinations of attributes. For eg: 87.1% of the population in the
United States had characteristics that made them uniquely identifiable
based only on three attributes of {5-digit ZIP, gender, date of birth}

A B S T R AC T Labor compliance’s purpose is keeping a safe and healthy work environment and
giving all employees a fair treatment by labor control mechanisms: (i) for employees,
by providing for additional control over the employer’s actions, fair compensation,
equal opportunities for recruitment and protection against abuse of office and
discrimination; and (ii) for employers, by enabling them to hire qualified employees
and to require employees to carry out their duties with due diligence.
The current level of CSR and labor compliance is mainly relied on the culture of
each organization and the extent of its ethical governance. Companies, which
approach CSR and labor compliance to help achieving their overall business goals,
will do far more than comply with their legal obligations and avoid fines.
The absence of a compliance culture with adequate instruments to address ethics,
equality and transparency issues, may be harmful for stakeholders. Bearing this in
mind, this paper reviews mandatory and voluntary labor compliance instruments for
organizations to handle, among others, with non-discrimination, equal pay, anti-
harassment, close the gap for women and fight against corruption matters.
Corporate social responsibility (CSR) and labor
compliance pursue going beyond legal compliance
issues. The purpose of both is not simply to fulfil legal
expectations, but making the environment and relations
with stakeholders beyond mere compliance with the
Law.
Although CSR is not a plain concept, CSR is whereby
business entities voluntarily incorporate social,
environmental and ethical standards into their
operations. CSR is built on three pillars: PROFIT
(economic), PEOPLE (social) and PLANET
(environmental area) – the triple “P”. Labor compliance
is included in the PEOPLE, social pillar of CSR.
LABOUR COMPLIANCE & CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY3
LABOR COMPLIANCE
STANDARDS AND PRINCIPLES
4
Successful organizations have in common a commitment to conduct
businesses according to high international standards and principles and to
build a corporate culture in line with these standards.
Labor compliance standards are included in the most international acts, of
which the three fundamental United Nations agreements on human rights:
the Universal Declaration; the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights; and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights.
Labor compliance standards are also incorporated into the core
conventions of the International Labor Organization, as well in acts
adopted at the European Union level and those approved by local law,
namely the Fundamental Law (Constituição da República Portuguesa), the
Portuguese Labor Code and complementary legislation.
Among these standards and principles, the principle of equality is
established, inter alia, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which
also includes provisions on social rights emphasizing the need of a social
security system and the important role of work, healthcare and education.
As to the right to work, the Declaration establishes that “Everyone has the
right to work, free choice of employment (…) and protection against
unemployment”, as well as “the right to equal pay for equal work”, and
regarding healthcare, “Motherhood and childhood are entitled to special
care and assistance.”
The European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights provides that “Equality
between men and women must be ensure in all areas, including
employment, work and pay”, specifying that “Every worker has the right to
protection against unjustified dismissal and the right to working conditions
which respect his/ her health, safety and dignity”, including “(…) the right
to the limitation of maximum working hours, to daily and weekly rest
periods and to an annual period of paid leave.”
All these standards and principles reinforce the idea of equality as non-
discrimination and fair opportunity in labor context serving the purpose of
ensuring citizens’ well-being and conciliating free market and social justice.
These are the grounds of the European Social Model.

HARD LAW AND SOFT LAW
6
Anglo-Saxon systems often distinguish hard law from soft law. ‘Hard law’
generally refers to legal obligations that are binding to the parties involved
and which can be legally enforced before a court. The term ‘soft law’ is
used to denote agreements, principles and declarations, which are quasi-
legal instruments, but do not have any legally binding force, or whose
binding force is somewhat weaker than the binding force of traditional law,
also referred to as hard law. Examples of soft law instruments are
statements, principles, code of practice, guidelines, policies.
Customarily, "soft law" is associated with international law, although more
recently it has been transferred to other spheres of domestic law. For
labour matters, soft law is complementary to hard law. Labor compliance
preferably results from the interaction between hard and soft law
instruments.
In Portugal, mandatory obligations and instruments of labor compliance may
vary according to the entity type. For instance, State-owned companies or
stock exchange listed companies are subject to stricter requirements. This
does not, however, mean that other entities may not follow the same
compliance standards or even different standards voluntarily applied
according to their ethical culture practices.
Regardless of the type of organization, there are common mandatory rules,
including:
▪ Use of biometric data for employees’ attendance control only and the
retention biometric data for the strictly required time (Article 18 of the
Portuguese Labor Code);
▪ Prohibition of use of remote surveillance means in the workplace to
monitor employees’ professional performance (Article 20/1 of the
Portuguese Labor Code);
▪ Prohibition of discriminatory practices before hiring and on the job
(Articles 30 and 31 of the Portuguese Labor Code);
▪ Record-keeping of employees’ working hours and overtime work
(Articles 202 and 231/1 of the Portuguese Labor Code);
▪ Preparation and display of employees’ holiday schedule until April 15
each year (Article 241/9 of the Portuguese Labor Code);
▪ Record-keeping of employees’ disciplinary sanctions (Article 332 of the
Portuguese Labor Code).

OVERVIEW
Detailed attention to labor compliance matters on non-discrimination,
equal pay, anti-harassment, close the gap for women and minorities, fight
against corruption and related offences, have been growing with major
changes brought by local laws. To follow these changes, employers are
compelled to apply a set of policies, procedures, and actions, of which:
▪ Code of Ethics and Conduct;
▪ Anti-Harassment Policy;
▪ Gender Equality Plan;
▪ Gender Pay Gap Report;
▪ Employees’ Training Plan;
▪ Corruption Risk Management Plan.
Depending on the type of organization, some of these instruments are
mandatory (e.g., employers hiring seven or more employees must adopt an
Anti-Harassment Policy; an Employees’ Training Plan is mandatory for a all
companies, except for very small companies).
CODE OF ETHICS AND CONDUCT
The Code of Ethics and Conduct is one of main instruments to embed the
company in a social responsibility culture. It has three main goals: (i) set
the fundamental principles and values of the company; (ii) define the
standards of conduct which employees must follow, regardless of their
position or function; and (iii) inform all stakeholders interacting with the
company on the fundamental ethical guidelines applicable in relations
between employees and shareholders, investors, customers, suppliers, and
society in general.
To ensure compliance with ethic principles and values of your company, a
whistleblowing platform may help address wrongdoings such as fraud and
misconduct. Companies that fail to recognise, address, and ultimately put
an end to such violations, risk exposing themselves to legal, social, and
reputational sanctions.
The appointment of an Ethics Committee – directly reporting to the Board
of Directors – may also have a relevant role. The Ethics Committee’s
purpose is to promote and strengthen good practices, as well as clarify
doubts, issue opinions on matters relating to compliance with the Code of
Ethics and Conduct and carry out the necessary inspections and diligences
with a view to solving irregularities.

ANTI-HARASSMENT POLICY
Harassment is a means of violence and abuse. In general, harassment is an
unwelcome recurring behavior (gesture, attitude, etc.) intended to affect a
person’s dignity or create an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or
destabilizing environment in the workplace.
Moral harassment may include verbal attacks with offensive or humiliating
content or indirect acts, including psychological or physical violence. The
four categories of moral harassment are: social isolation, professional
discrimination, intimidation and personal humiliation.
Sexual harassment may comprise attempts at physical contact, disturbance,
requests for sexual favors in exchange of benefits, blackmail, and even use
of force or strategies to compel the other person's willingness.
To give awareness on the need to prevent and fight against harassment
situations in the workplace and ensuring each employee the right to work
in a good dignity conditions environment, employers hiring seven or more
employees must prepare and publish an Anti-Harassment Policy.
The drafting of this policy should follow the guidelines issued by the local
authority for equality in labor and employment (Comissão para a Igualdade
no Trabalho e no Emprego).
GENDER EQUALITY PLAN (GEP)
Employers must keep an integrated approach as to the promotion of
equality of opportunities on grounds of age, sexual orientation, religious or
similar philosophical belief, race, disability, political opinion, sex,
pregnancy/maternity leave, married status/civil partnership status.
To achieve these goal, employers must approve a Gender Equality Plan
(GEP) to promote equal treatment and opportunities between women and
men, end sex-based discrimination and safeguard conciliation between
personal, family, and professional life.
For listed companies, public sector companies and local public sector
companies, a GEP is mandatory.
For State-owned companies, the GEP is ruled by the Ministers’ Council
Order 19/2012 of March 8, 2012; Decree-Law 133/2013, of October 3,
2013; and the Ministers’ Council Order 18/2014, of March 7, 2017. Law
62/2017, of August 1, 2017, then extended the obligation to implement a
GEP to companies listed on the stock exchange.
A GEP is a good CSR practice and hence well-recommended to be applied
by employers in general, even though they are not bound by mandatory
rules.

LABOR COMPLIANCE AND CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY12
GENDER EQUALITY PLAN (GEP)
Order 18/2019, of June 17, 2019, lists the mandatory matters to be
covered by a GEP. Employers, when drafting a GEP, must be aware that the
GEP must handle the following matters:
▪ Equal conditions before hiring and on the job;
▪ Equal pay;
▪ Parenthood safeguards; and
▪ Conciliation between personal, family, and professional life.
The drafting of a GEP may require additional care, as a GEP must follow a
specific legal procedure, as well a set of guidelines issued by the local
authority for equality in labor and employment (Comissão para a Igualdade
no Trabalho e no Emprego). A GEP must include, inter alia, a diagnosis of the
current company’s status, and the measures to be applied by the employer,
including new measures, if needed, for the GEP to be effectively applied.
The GEP will be subject to review by the local authority, which has powers
to control whether the relevant measures are being putting into practice
and to recommend revised and additional measures. The GEP must be
prepared/reviewed by employers on an annual basis.
GENDER PAY GAP REPORT
Historically, women’s average pay is lower than men. Since last decade,
specific measures have been created to mitigate this scenario, even though
the gender pay gap persists.
In general, labour law imposes employers to promote a transparent pay
policy based on objective criteria and on an evaluation of different job
requirements.
For State-owned companies, subject to stricter requirements, the
Ministers’ Council Order 13/2013, of March 8, 2013, envisages to promote
equal opportunities between men and women and eliminate wage
differences, labor market segregation and other forms of discrimination in
the public business sector.
Ministers’ Council Order 18/2014, of March 8, 2014, also imposes State-
owned companies to prepare a Gender Pay Gap Report every three years
and where they review employees’ salaries, in order to identify and
mitigate gender salaries gap.
The Gender Pay Gap Report must be made available to all employees and
be publicised on the company’s website.

EMPLOYEES’ TRAINING PLAN
Currently, professional training is a need and condition to achieve
competitive proficiency in the labor context. Professional training is
essential to the growth and improvement of each business.
Training is a comprehensive and ongoing process of getting and increasing
professional skills that prepare employees to better perform their jobs.
The goal of professional training is to respond to a set of challenges and
incorporate employees’ training needs into the mission and strategic
objectives of the organization, including, inter alia, providing better
qualifications to young people entering the job market, to employees with
disabilities or at risk of unemployment or belonging to groups with social
inclusion needs.
For this purpose, the Portuguese Labor Code imposes employers to
provide employees with professional training, which must be organized by
means of an Employees’ Training Plan.
Employers are obliged to provide professional training sessions (by itself or
through third-party providers) to employees, who must attend these
training sessions.
CORRUPTION RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN
A Corruption Risk Management Plan is mandatory for all public entities,
including those governed by private law, that carry out management
activities involving public money and assets. This plan aims to prevent
corruption activities and related offences. The Corruption Risk
Management Plan must identify the possible risks of corruption (according
to a risk matrix) within the organization and define the measures required
to eliminate or reduce such risks.
For public entities, the guidelines to design a Corruption Risk Management
Plan are set out in two different recommendations: the Recommendation of
November 7, 2012; and the Recommendation of July 1, 2015. These
guidelines impose that the plan details: (i) the risks identified per each
entity’s business unit; (ii) a list of preventive measures to eradicate or
mitigate the identified risks; and (iii) the employees in charge for managing
the Corruption Risk Management Plan.
Public entities must also prepare an annual report on the implementation
of the Corruption Risk Management Plan, explaining which measures to
face the identified risks were taken and the relevant outcomes. In case
some failures are identified, the annual report must refer them and the
performed measures.

ANTI-BRIBERY POLICY
1. Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to establish controls to ensure compliance with all applicable anti-bribery
and corruption regulations, and to ensure that the Company’s business is conducted in a socially
responsible manner.
2. Policy statement
Bribery is the offering, promising, giving, accepting or soliciting of an advantage as an inducement
for action which is illegal or a breach of trust. A bribe is an inducement or reward offered, promised or
provided in order to gain any commercial, contractual, regulatory or personal advantage.
It is our policy to conduct all of our business in an honest and ethical manner. We take a zero- tolerance
approach to bribery and corruption. We are committed to acting professionally, fairly and with integrity
in all our business dealings and relationships wherever we operate and implementing and enforcing
effective systems to counter bribery.
We will uphold all laws relevant to countering bribery and corruption in all the jurisdictions in which we
operate. However, we remain bound by the laws in Australia in respect of our conduct both at home and
abroad.
Bribery and corruption are punishable for individuals by up to ten years' imprisonment and a fine. If we
are found to have taken part in corruption, we could face an unlimited fine, be excluded from tendering
for public contracts and face damage to our reputation. We therefore take our legal responsibilities very
seriously.
3. Scope
3.1 Who is covered by the policy?
In this policy, third party means any individual or organisation you come into contact with during the
course of your work for us, and includes actual and potential clients, customers, suppliers, distributors,
business contacts, agents, advisers, and government and public bodies, including their advisors,
representatives and officials, politicians and political parties.
This policy applies to all individuals working at all levels and grades, including senior managers, officers,
directors, employees (whether permanent, fixed-term or temporary), consultants, contractors, trainees,
seconded staff, homeworkers, casual workers and agency staff, volunteers, interns, agents, sponsors, or
any other person associated with us, or any of our subsidiaries or their employees, wherever located
(collectively referred to as employees in this policy).
This policy covers:
• Bribes;
• Gifts and hospitality;
• Facilitation payments;
• Political contributions;
• Charitable contributions.
3.2 Bribes
Employees must not engage in any form of bribery, either directly or through any third party (such as an
agent or distributor). Specifically, employees must not bribe a foreign public official anywhere in the
world.
3.3 Gifts and hospitality
Employees must not offer or give any gift or hospitality:
GRA.POL014 Issue 01
• which could be regarded as illegal or improper, or which violates the recipient’s policies; or
• to any public employee or government officials or representatives, or politicians or political
parties; or
• which exceeds $100 in value for each individual gift or $500 in value for each hospitality
event (not to exceed a total value of $1000 in any financial year), unless approved in writing by
the employee’s manager.
Employees may not accept any gift or hospitality from our business partners if:
• it exceeds $100 in value for each individual gift or $500 in value for each hospitality event (not
to exceed a total of $1000 in any financial year), unless approved in writing by the
employee’s manager; or
• it is in cash; or
• there is any suggestion that a return favour will be expected or implied.
Where a manager’s approval is required above, if the manager is below Director level then approval
must be sought from an appropriate Director.
If it is not appropriate to decline the offer of a gift, the gift may be accepted, provided it is then declared to
the employee’s manager and donated to charity.
We appreciate that the practice of giving business gifts varies between countries and regions and what
may be normal and acceptable in one region may not be in another. The test to be applied is whether in
all the circumstances the gift or hospitality is reasonable and justifiable. The intention behind the gift should
always be considered.
Within these parameters, local management may define specific guidelines and policies to reflect local
professional and industry standards. Where this policy requires written approval to be given, the Company
Secretary shall put in place a process to maintain a register of all such approvals.
3.4 Facilitation payments and kickbacks
Facilitation payments are a form of bribery made for the purpose of expediting or facilitating the
performance of a public official for a routine governmental action, and not to obtain or retain business
or any improper business advantage. Facilitation payments tend to be demanded by low level
officials to obtain a level of service which one would normally be entitled to.
Our strict policy is that facilitation payments must not be paid. We recognise, however, that our
employees may be faced with situations where there is a risk to the personal security of an employee or
his/her family and where a facilitation payment is unavoidable, in which case the following steps must be
taken:
• Keep any amount to the minimum;
• Create a record concerning the payment; and
• Report it to your line manager.
In order to achieve our aim of not making any facilitation payments, each business of the Company
will keep a record of all payments made, which must be reported to the Company Secretary, in order to
evaluate the business risk and to develop a strategy to minimise such payments in the future.
3.5 Political Contributions
We do not make donations, whether in cash or kind, in support of any political parties or candidates,
as this can be perceived as an attempt to gain an improper business advantage.
3.6 Charitable contributions
Charitable support and donations are acceptable (and indeed are encouraged), whether of in- kind
services, knowledge, time, or direct financial contributions. However, employees must be careful to
ensure that charitable contributions are not used as a scheme to conceal bribery. We only make
charitable donations that are legal and ethical under local laws and practices]. No donation must be
offered or made without the prior approval of [the compliance manager.
All charitable contributions should be publicly disclosed.
GRA.POL014 Issue 01
4. Your responsibilities
You must ensure that you read, understand and comply with this policy.
The prevention, detection and reporting of bribery and other forms of corruption are the responsibility
of all those working for us or under our control. All employees are required to avoid any activity that
might lead to, or suggest, a breach of this policy.
You must notify your manager OR the Company Secretary or the confidential helpline as soon as
possible if you believe or suspect that a conflict with or breach of this policy has occurred, or may
occur in the future.
Any employee who breaches this policy will face disciplinary action, which could result in dismissal for
gross misconduct. We reserve our right to terminate our contractual relationship with other workers if they
breach this policy.
5. Record-keeping
We must keep financial records and have appropriate internal controls in place which will evidence the
business reason for making payments to third parties.
You must declare and keep a written record of all hospitality or gifts accepted or offered, which will be
subject to managerial review.
You must ensure all expenses claims relating to hospitality, gifts or expenses incurred to third
parties are submitted in accordance with our expenses policy and specifically record the reason for
the expenditure.
All accounts, invoices, memoranda and other documents and records relating to dealings with third parties,
such as clients, suppliers and business contacts, should be prepared and maintained with strict
accuracy and completeness. No accounts must be kept "off-book" to facilitate or conceal improper
payments.
6. How to raise a concern
You are encouraged to raise concerns about any issue or suspicion of malpractice at the earliest
possible stage. If you are unsure whether a particular act constitutes bribery or corruption, or if you
have any other queries or concerns, these should be raised with your line manager OR the Company
Secretary or through the confidential helpline.
7. What to do if you are a victim of bribery or corruption
It is important that you tell the Company Secretary or the confidential helpline as soon as possible if
you are offered a bribe by a third party, are asked to make one, suspect that this may happen in the
future, or believe that you are a victim of another form of unlawful activity.
8. Protection
Employees who refuse to accept or offer a bribe, or those who raise concerns or report another's
wrongdoing, are sometimes worried about possible repercussions. We aim to encourage openness and
will support anyone who raises genuine concerns in good faith under this policy, even if they turn out to
be mistaken.
We are committed to ensuring no one suffers any detrimental treatment as a result of refusing to take part
in bribery or corruption, or because of reporting in good faith their suspicion that an actual or potential
bribery or other corruption offence has taken place, or may take place in the future. Detrimental treatment
includes dismissal, disciplinary action, threats or other unfavourable treatment connected with raising a
concern. If you believe that you have suffered any such treatment, you should inform Colm Shevlin
immediately. If the matter is not remedied, and you are an employee, you should raise it formally
using the company’s Grievance Procedure.

ANTI-BRIBERY & CORRUPTION POLICY
1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 The Board of Directors of Ascendant Resources Inc.1 has determined that, on the
recommendation of the Corporate Governance Committee, Ascendant should formalise its policy
on compliance with the anti-corruption laws, including the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 1977
and the Canadian Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act 1999.
1.2 This Anti-Bribery & Corruption Policy (the "Policy") will supersede any other existing Ascendant
policies relating to bribery and corruption.
1.3 The Compliance Officer is the Chief Financial Officer.
2 POLICY STATEMENT
2.1 It is Ascendant's policy to conduct all of its business in an honest and ethical manner. Ascendant
takes a zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption and is committed to acting
professionally, fairly and with integrity in all its business dealings and relationships. It is the goal
of Ascendant to avoid acts which might reflect adversely upon the integrity and reputation of the
Company.
2.2 Individuals involved in corrupt activity may be fined or sentenced to imprisonment. Further, if
Ascendant or any of its employees or associated persons (e.g. contractors, agents or
subsidiaries) is found to have taken part in corruption, Ascendant could face an unlimited fine,
and it could face serious damage to its reputation both in the public markets and in the countries
in which it operates. Ascendant therefore takes its legal responsibilities very seriously.
2.3 Ascendant is committed to upholding all laws relevant to countering bribery and corruption in
each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. As the anti-corruption laws of the UK, US and
Canada have extraterritorial application, Ascendant, its employees and associated persons will
be bound by the most stringent requirements of these laws in respect of its conduct in all
jurisdictions they operate, even if such conduct would otherwise be permitted by the local law of a
particular jurisdiction.
2.4 The purpose of this Policy is to:
 set out the responsibilities of Ascendant, and all individuals who work for Ascendant, in
observing and upholding the Company's position on bribery and corruption; and
1 This Policy applies to Ascendant Resources Inc. and all of its subsidiaries. Accordingly, this Policy will refer to Ascendant and its
subsidiaries as "Ascendant" or the "Company".
ANTI-BRIBERY & CORRUPTION POLICY

 provide information and guidance to those individuals working for Ascendant on how to
recognise and deal with bribery and corruption issues.
2.5 In this Policy, "third party" means any individual or organisation with whom you may come into
contact during the course of your work for Ascendant, and includes actual and potential
customers, suppliers, distributors, business contacts, agents, advisers, and government and
public bodies, including their advisors, representatives and officials, politicians and political
parties.
3 APPLICATION OF THE POLICY
3.1 The Policy applies to all directors, officers, employees, family members, consultants and
contractors of Ascendant. Compliance with this Policy constitutes terms of service for each
director, conditions of employment for each officer and employee, and conditions of providing
services to Ascendant for each consultant and contractor. Each such person agrees to be bound
by the provisions of this Policy upon notification of the most recent copy being given to them or
upon notification that an updated version has been placed on Ascendant's website for review.
3.2 This Policy extends across all of the Company's business dealings and in all countries and
territories in which the Company operates. All persons covered by this Policy, in discharging their
duties on behalf of Ascendant, are required to comply with the laws, rules and regulations
applicable in the location in which Ascendant is performing business activities, and in particular
with respect to anti-bribery and corruption laws, rules and regulations. Where uncertainty or
ambiguity exists, please contact the Compliance Officer who may seek further legal advice.

1. INTRODUCTION
CODE OF CONDUCT AND ETHICS
The Company aims to be the industry leader by achieving excellence in everything it does
including standards of business conduct. This objective shall be achieved by adopting a
policy to conduct its business with responsibility, integrity, fairness, transparency and
honesty.
The purpose of this Code of Conduct and Ethics (“Code” or “Code of Conduct”) is to
promote conduct of business ethically in an efficient and transparent manner and to meet
its obligations to shareholders and all other stakeholders. This Code is also a tool in
carrying out the Company’s social responsibility in a more effective manner. This Code
sets out a broad policy for one’s conduct in dealing with the Company, fellow directors and
employees and the external environment in which the Company operates.
2. APPLICATION OF THIS CODE
This Code of Conduct applies to all the directors and all the Employees of the Company.
For the purpose of this Code:-
“Board” means the Board of Directors of the Company;
“Company” means Chambal Fertilisers and Chemicals Limited
“Employee” means every person on permanent or temporary rolls of the Company at its
various business locations;
“Director” means a member of the Board; and
“Senior Management Personnel” means the officers / personnel of the Company
identified as senior management in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act,
2013 and Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure
Requirements) Regulations, 2015.
Where the Company is a major or strategic shareholder in another company, that company
should also be made aware of this Code and encouraged to have similar Code.
We aim to choose as business partners, people with high moral and ethical values
compatible with our own. If we find ourselves in a business relationship with anyone (e.g.
distributor, agent, joint venture partner, supplier, etc.) where it is clear that there is a serious
incompatibility which cannot be resolved, we will seek to terminate the relationship.
3. REGULATORY COMPLIANCE
The Company is committed to high standards of corporate governance and believes in
compliance with all the laws and regulations both in letter and spirit. The Company has
endeavoured to set standards for itself, which are ahead of the times and higher than those
stipulated by law. The Company is committed to provide in time, accurate and complete
information as required, to all concerned including its stakeholders.
Page 2 of 6
4. RESPECT FOR INDIVIDUAL
The Company’s vision is based on inspiring and unleashing creative potential in human
assets of the Company. This is possible in an environment where we all respect the rights
of those around us. In this direction, the Company shall:
treat individuals in all aspects of employment solely on the basis of ability irrespective
of race, caste, creed, religion, age, disability, gender, sexual orientation or marital
status; and
not tolerate racial, sexual or any other kind of harassment.
5. HONEST AND ETHICAL CONDUCT
The Directors and Employees of the Company should act in accordance with the highest
standards of personal and professional integrity, honesty and ethical conduct. Honest
conduct is conduct that is free from any fraud or deception. Ethical conduct is conduct
conforming to accepted professional standards of conduct and shall include ethical
handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
relationships.
Employees shall refrain from using their personal connections, relationships etc. to exert
external intervention and/or force to influence the Company’s decisions on any matter
relating to day-to-day working, furtherance of their personal interests, including but not
limited to promotion, transfer, job rotation etc.
6. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
The Directors and Employees shall not engage in any activity or enter into any pecuniary
relationship which might result in conflict of interest, either directly or indirectly.
A “conflict of interest” occurs when an individual’s personal interest directly or indirectly
interferes or appears to interfere with the interest of the Company. The Directors and
Employees must act at all times in the Company’s best interest and avoid putting
themselves in a position where their personal interest conflict or appear to conflict with the
interest of the Company. Their personal interest will also include those of their immediate
relatives. Any Director, Senior Management Personnel or other Employee, who is aware
of a conflict of interest or is concerned that a conflict might develop, is required to disclose
the matter promptly to the Board in case of a Director and Senior Management Personnel
and to the Managing Director in case of any other Employee.
7. MISUSE OF OPPORTUNITIES AND INFORMATION
The Directors and Employees owe a duty to the Company to advance the Company’s
business interest when appropriate. The Directors and Employees are prohibited from
taking (or directing to a third party) a business opportunity (relevant to the line of business
intended to be pursued by the Company) that is discovered through the use of Company
property, information or position, unless the Company has already been offered the
opportunity and turned it down. The Directors and Employees are prohibited from using
Company property, information or position for personal gain and from competing with the
Company. Wherever, it is difficult to differentiate between personal and Company benefits
or there are both personal and Company benefits in certain activities, the only prudent course
of conduct for the Directors and Employees is to make sure that any use of Company
property or services or such transaction that is not solely for the benefit of the Company
has prior approval of the competent authority.

1 Introduction
A Message from Sharon Ryzak
Chief Compliance Officer
The Compliance Awareness Training you are about to take will give you a
better understanding of our Code of Conduct and your role in the
Compliance Program. You should have already received the Code of
Conduct which covers the basic standards and principles that we must
follow to perform our job in a legal and ethical manner.
I want to emphasize the importance of this training. The Department
takes very seriously its obligation to comply with the laws, regulations
and standards of conduct that govern the Department’s business. This
commitment to compliance starts with the Board of Supervisors and is
needed at every level of the Department, from the Director to you.
It is not only our duty to follow the standards of conduct; we are also
expected to take action if we see that these standards are not being met.
This training and our Code of Conduct include information on how to
report concerns, and on the protections against retaliation when you act
in good faith. Don’t hesitate to ask questions if something doesn’t seem
right.
We must all be committed to honest and responsible conduct. We owe
this to our patients, to the community, and to ourselves to maintain our
integrity.
Thank you for your attention to this important information and for doing
your part to ensure that we act responsibly and in full compliance with
the law.
COMPLIANCE AWARENESS TRAINING

2 Training Purpose
At the end of this lesson, you will:
• Be familiar with the Department of Health Services (DHS)
Compliance Program;
• Have a better understanding of DHS’ expectations, standards,
and policies related to workplace ethics and compliance;
• Recognize ethical and legal issues that may affect you and your
work;
• Know what resources are available when you need guidance or
need to report a violation; and
• Be aware of DHS’ commitment to integrity in all of its business
activities.
3 Who needs to attend this training?
All current workforce members including employees, volunteers, active
members of the medical staff, students and on-site contract personnel
are required to complete the Compliance Awareness Training. New
workforce members will receive this training at the start of their
service.
Compliance Awareness Training is important because you are held
responsible to the Department’s standards and must meet those
expectations.
You will need to participate in Compliance Awareness Training updates
every two years.
4 DHS Compliance Program
The DHS Compliance Program is a comprehensive strategy developed
to prevent, detect, and correct inappropriate conduct. It is consistent
with the Department’s values and objectives, which include compliance
with laws and other requirements as one of its standards of conduct.
The program ensures that we follow the many, and often complex,
requirements imposed upon us and addresses the increased scrutiny
the healthcare industry is under. You do not have to look far to find
news about a healthcare organization in trouble for some kind of
COMPLIANCE AWARENESS TRAINING
___________________________________________________________________

misconduct, such as billing for unnecessary services or billing for
services not provided.
Federal and State agencies have been given increased funding and
authority to investigate and prosecute healthcare fraud and abuse.
These government investigations have resulted in negative publicity,
multi-million dollar fines, and, in the most serious cases, prison
sentences and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare
programs.
4.1 Goals
The goals of the Compliance Program are to:
• Protect the organization, its patients, and the community by
providing clear guidelines to ensure honest and responsible
behavior;
• Prevent, identify and correct violations of the law, regulations,
and/or DHS policy
• Fulfill our legal duty to our payers by submitting accurate claims
for reimbursement consistent with program requirements;
• Limit the risk of violating the law;
No matter what your function is, you are a critical part of the success
of the Compliance Program because the overall goal of the Compliance
Program is integrity in all operations.
4.2 Scope
The overarching goal of the Compliance Program is compliance with all
laws, regulations, policies, and other applicable standards of conduct.
Despite this broad goal, the primary focus of the Compliance Program
is on the laws related to healthcare business practices and the
requirements of our primary payers (especially Medicare and Medi-
Cal).
COMPLIANCE AWARENESS TRAINING
___________________________________________________________________
4
Some of the areas the Compliance Program focuses on include:
• Coding and billing – to ensure that all claims for
reimbursement are accurate and consistent with the applicable
laws, regulations, and program requirements.
• Medical record documentation – to ensure that medical
records are accurate, timely, and complete.
• Cost reporting - to ensure the accuracy of these reports
because they are basis for much of DHS' revenue.
• Patient referrals for services – to ensure patient referrals do
not violate the anti-referral laws, which limit the situations in
which a physician can order services.
• Financial arrangements – to ensure that financial
arrangements are proper and do not violate laws, such as the
anti-kickback laws, which make it illegal to accept or offer
anything of economic value that is intended to encourage the
referral of patients or other business.
• Other conflicts of interest which are inconsistent with a
workforce member’s official duties.
• Excluded persons or entities – to ensure that we do not
employ or contract with individuals or entities that have been
excluded from participation in federal healthcare programs (such
as Medicare and Medi-Cal) because of fraud, abuse, or some
other kind of misconduct.
• Confidentiality of health information – to protect the privacy
of patients’ health information.
4.3 Related Activities
There are other significant compliance-related activities that are
managed outside of the Compliance Program. These include, but are
not limited to, activities related to:
• Quality of care,
• Licensing and accreditation,
• Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA),
• Human resources, and
• Clinical research.
Keep in mind, no matter what your function is, you are a critical part
of the success of the Compliance Program because the overall goal of
the Compliance Program is integrity in all operations.
COMPLIANCE AWARENESS TRAINING

4.4 Essential Elements
The Federal Department of Health and Human Services Office of the
Inspector General (OIG) considers seven elements to be essential to
an effective Compliance Program. These elements are:
1. Chief Compliance Officer and Compliance Committee
2. A Code of Conduct and policies and procedures to help ensure
that we follow the various laws and regulations;
3. A process for reporting and investigating compliance concerns;
4. Education of workforce members, which relates both to the
nature of the compliance program, and to job-specific education
on the various rules which effect job performance;
5. Monitoring and auditing, to test whether we are doing things
right, and make sure that any problems are caught and
corrected early;
6. Response to reported concerns and prevention of future
problems; and
7. Enforcement and discipline. The OIG feels very strongly that
compliance is considered a priority only when there are
consequences for non-compliant behavior.
The DHS Compliance Program includes these essential elements which
are discussed in more detail below.
COMPLIANCE AWARENESS TRAINING
___________________________________________________________________

5 Compliance Program Participants
DHS COMPLIANCE PROGRAM
As shown above, the Compliance Program is comprised of the:
• Chief Compliance Officer
• Local Compliance Officers from each facility,
• Compliance Committee (which includes Local Compliance
Officers and other key managers)
• Audit and Compliance Division, and
• You, the most important participant. This includes all DHS
workforce members (employees, volunteers, students,
contractors and active members of the medical staff.) You are
the critical ingredient for the success of our Compliance
Program. It cannot work without you.
The following sections discuss the roles of each of these participants.
5.1 DHS Chief Compliance Officer
The DHS Chief Compliance Officer is Sharon Ryzak. The Chief
Compliance Officer is accountable for overseeing the implementation of
the Compliance Program, and for taking steps to improve its
effectiveness. She also acts as the Compliance Program’s liaison with
the Board of Supervisors.
COMPLIANCE AWARENESS TRAINING
___________________________________________________________________
7
5.2 Local Compliance Officers
Each facility/program has designated a Local Compliance Officer to
assist in the implementation of the Compliance Program by
coordinating compliance activities at their respective facility or
program. They act as a compliance resource for their facility and are
someone you can go to when you have questions or concerns. They
also participate on the DHS Compliance Committee.
The Local Compliance Officers for DHS are:
LAC+USC Healthcare Network Barbara Oliver (323) 409-3501
Coastal Cluster Cynthia M. Oliver (310) 222-4027
MLK-MACC Vanessa Brown (310) 668-4966
ValleyCare Azar Kattan (818) 364-3001
Rancho Los Amigos National
Rehabilitation Center Jody Knox (562) 401-7025
High Desert Health System Beryl Brooks (661) 945-8311
Office of Managed Care/CHP Nancy Pe Quilino (626) 299-3348
Health Services Administration Kathy Markarian (213) 240-8312
5.3 Compliance Committee
The Compliance Committee is comprised of Local Compliance Officers
and managers from other key areas such as Finance, Nursing, and
Health Information Management. It prepares and approves policies to
ensure compliance with the law, identifies areas of concern, and
initiates and sets priorities for compliance activities. The Compliance
Committee also advises the Chief Compliance Officer about compliance
matters, such as potential violations, changes in requirements, and
ways to improve the Compliance Program.
5.4 Audit and Compliance Division
The Audit and Compliance Division conducts compliance audits and
investigations. It investigates all matters brought to its attention and
recommends corrective actions as appropriate. The Audit and
Compliance Division receives reports of alleged misconduct from the
Board of Supervisors’ offices, the County Fraud Hotline, the DHS
Compliance Hotline, and other sources. It also does monitoring and
compliance reviews at the request of the Compliance Committee.
COMPLIANCE AWARENESS TRAINING

5.5 You
Each workforce member is a critical player in the Compliance Program.
Your responsibilities as a workforce member are to act with integrity
and honesty, and to follow the DHS Code of Conduct, laws,
regulations, and other standards that apply to your job.
Additionally, every workforce member has the additional duty to report
suspected misconduct. You are in the best position to know whether
we are doing things correctly, and it is essential that you share that
information.
6 Compliance Violations and Misconduct
DHS strives to comply with all federal, State, and local laws that apply
to it, and its own policies.
Examples of compliance violations and other types of
misconduct are:
• False claims or other inappropriate billing practices - such as
billing for unnecessary services, billing for services not
performed or not documented in the medical record, deliberately
billing twice for the same item or service, etc.,
• Accepting or paying kickbacks (which includes anything of value)
in exchange for patient referrals or other business,
• Falsifying cost reports,
• Miscoding services,
• Acting under a conflict of interest, for example, by not disclosing
that you own a company that does business with DHS,
• Falsifying timecards,
• Misleading an investigator or auditor,
• Destroying documents related to an investigation,
• Falsifying any record including medical records and employment
applications,
• Disclosing protected health information to an unauthorized
person, and
• Accepting gifts from, or giving gifts to, individuals or
organizations that have a business relationship with DHS.
COMPLIANCE AWARENESS TRAINING
___________________________________________________________________
9
These actions are unethical, and in many cases illegal. You must not
participate in any of these practices or any other type of misconduct.
DHS expects its workforce members to follow the rules and will
support you in your efforts to ensure honest and responsible conduct.
More examples of inappropriate behavior will be covered in the case
studies later.
7 Reporting Misconduct
As noted above, it is your duty to report suspected inappropriate or
illegal conduct to protect the organization and the community we
serve. The purpose of such reporting is to allow DHS to correct
problems before they get out of hand. This helps avoid fines and
penalties, damage to the public’s trust, and will help ensure that we
act with honesty and integrity by doing the right thing.
7.1 The 3C Decision-Making Model © :
The following 3C Decision-Making Model can be used when you are
faced with an ethical or compliance concern.
The three C’s are:
Compliance: Does the situation involve the possible violation of a
law, regulation, or internal policy or procedure?
Conscience: Does the situation involve a violation of an ethical
principle?
Conduct: Assess your alternatives for addressing the situation and
decide on a course of action that will resolve the situation in a timely
manner.

7.2 Reporting Avenues
There are several reporting avenues you can use if you suspect
misconduct or fraud. You can:
• Discuss your concerns and questions with your
supervisor. Generally, we recommend that you talk to your
supervisor first. However, if there are special circumstances —
COMPLIANCE AWARENESS TRAINING
___________________________________________________________________
10
for instance, if you suspect your supervisor may be involved in
the potential misconduct — you would want to go through
another reporting avenue.
• Discuss your concerns and questions with another
member of management. You may need the expertise of
another manager or you may feel more comfortable discussing
your concerns with another manager.
• Contact your Local Compliance Officer.
• Contact the Audit and Compliance Division by:
o Phone - DHS Compliance Hotline – (800) 711-5366
o Letter – 313 N Figueroa St., Room 801, Los Angeles 90012
o Fax – (213) 481-8460
• Contact the Chief Compliance Officer directly at any time.
7.3 DHS Compliance Hotline (800) 711-5366
As noted above, the DHS Compliance Hotline is one way to report
suspected compliance violations and ask questions about the Code of
Conduct or other compliance issues.
You do not need to use your name, but keep in mind that anonymous
calls may be difficult to investigate.
7.4 County Fraud Hotline (800) 544-6861
The DHS Compliance Hotline has not replaced or changed the Los
Angeles County Fraud Hotline. The County Fraud Hotline, which is
staffed by the Auditor-Controller's office, can be used to report either
misconduct or fraudulent activity.
7.5 Confidentiality
Every effort is made to maintain the confidentiality of a reporter’s
identity, within the limits of the law and the practical necessities of
conducting an investigation. However, DHS cannot guarantee
confidentiality. For instance, if legal or civil service action is required,
the person who reported the issue may have to be identified.
COMPLIANCE AWARENESS TRAINING
___________________________________________________________________
11
7.6 Protection from Retaliation
County Code Section 5.02.060 (Whistle-Blower Ordinance) protects
persons who report suspected misconduct or fraud to an appropriate
County entity from retaliation by County officers, managers, or
employees. There are also federal and State laws that protect persons
who disclose or participate in federal and State investigations from
retaliation in the form of harassment, demotion or firing.
DHS will not tolerate retaliation against anyone who reports a
suspected violation.
Remember, you are responsible for your own conduct. This protection
from retaliation does not mean that there may not be consequences
for your actions if you report a problem in which you have played a
part. Reporting a problem that you participated in will not excuse
misconduct on your part. Also, any employee who makes a false
accusation with the purpose of harming or retaliating against another
workforce member will be subject to disciplinary action.
7.7 Audit and Compliance Division’s
Investigation Process
The Audit and Compliance Division investigates (or refers for
investigation) all reported matters. DHS treats all reports of alleged
misconduct seriously and appropriately.
When you report possible misconduct, the Audit and Compliance
Division will take the following steps:
1. Assuming you did not make your report anonymously, the Audit
and Compliance staff will contact you as soon as possible.
Depending on existing priorities, you may not receive a call
immediately, but if not, please be assured that all cases will be
investigated as appropriate. You will be asked to describe the
situation and to provide as much detail about it as possible. It is
important to be as specific as possible and to provide any
documentation you have to support your concerns.
2. Audit and Compliance will conduct the review to determine
if a problem really exists and if any corrective action is needed.
COMPLIANCE AWARENESS TRAINING
___________________________________________________________________
12
This review may include conducting additional interviews,
examining relevant documentation, reviewing relevant laws and
policies, and any other steps needed to assess the reported
concern.
3. Audit and Compliance will issue a report of the findings to
facility administration with recommendations for corrective and
disciplinary action, as appropriate.
Disciplinary action will be taken in accordance with the
Department’s Employee Evaluation and Discipline Guidelines and
Civil Service Rules. The Compliance Program does not establish
additional disciplinary guidelines.
Corrective action for the misconduct of contractor personnel, will be
taken in accordance with the contract provisions.
DHS recognizes that, without appropriate enforcement, the
standards are meaningless.
8 Code of Conduct
The DHS Code of Conduct states the basic standards and principles
that we must follow to carry out our job in a legal and ethical manner.
It provides you with guidelines for workplace conduct. Since the Code
of Conduct provides only general guidance, you should refer to the
COMPLIANCE AWARENESS TRAINING
___________________________________________________________________
13
applicable policies, regulations, or other directives when additional
guidance is needed.
The Code of Conduct and policies can be found on the DHS and
facilities’ Intranets.
8.1 How does it affect you?
The Code of Conduct provides you with help regarding appropriate
workplace conduct. It is important for you to be familiar with the Code
of Conduct because all workforce members are expected to follow the
Code of Conduct. Non-compliance with the Code of Conduct, if
discovered, will result in appropriate disciplinary actions. Failure of
supervisors/managers to assure compliance by those they manage
may also result in disciplinary actions.
At the end of this training, you will be expected to sign an
acknowledgement stating that you have received the Code of Conduct
and will comply with its terms. You are expected to be familiar and
comply with the laws, regulations, and policies that govern your job
function. You are not expected to know everything, but are expected
to ASK if you are unsure of your responsibilities.
9 Federal and State Fraud and Abuse Laws
There are a variety of federal and state laws designed to prevent or
remedy fraud and abuse in federal healthcare programs. We discuss
several of the most important of these below.
9.1 Federal False Claims Act
The Federal False Claims Act creates financial penalties for submitting
certain types of inaccurate materials to the federal government.
Congress is very serious about this law and very recently amended it
to expand the scope of activities to which it applies. The State of
California also has a false claims act.
COMPLIANCE AWARENESS TRAINING
___________________________________________________________________
14
Prohibited actions under the Federal False Claims Act include:
 Submitting a false or fraudulent claim,
 Creating or using a false document which is material to a false
claim,
 Conspiring to violate the false claims act,
 Creating a false record to avoid returning some or all of what is
owed to the federal government, and
 Inappropriately avoiding, or decreasing an obligation to pay
money or property to the federal government.
The last item, which was added by the recent amendment, means that
failure to return overpayments to the government, once you know
they exist, can be a violation of the law even when the overpayment
itself was not the product of fraud or other error by the Department.
In addition to taking one of these prohibited actions, to violate the
False Claims Act, a person must have submitted the claim or document
knowing that the information or claim is false or fraudulent, acted in
deliberate ignorance of the truth or inaccuracy of the information or
claim, or acted with reckless disregard of the truth or inaccuracy of the
information or claim.
Violating this law knowingly can also lead to criminal prosecution.
For your reference, federal and state laws dealing with false claims are
covered in more detail in DHS Policy 1003 - False Claims Act.
9.2 Whistleblower Provisions
Generally, the False Claims Act is enforced by the Attorney General’s
office. However, a private person who has non-public information
about wrongdoing may file a false claims lawsuit on behalf of the
government. This person is called a ‘whistleblower’ or ‘Qui Tam
Relator.’ The whistleblower gets a share of any recovery.
The whistleblower, and anyone assisting the whistleblower, is
protected from retaliation by law. As described previously, County
rules as well as other State law provisions give additional protection to
persons who report suspected wrongdoing.

10 Accurate Claims
DHS tries to ensure that all claims for reimbursement are accurate and
conform to the applicable rules. This means that the claims contain all
the required information and that the information is correct.
DHS prohibits any workforce member from knowingly presenting, or
causing to be presented, false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims.
Activities that can impact the accuracy of a claim are:
 Medical record documentation,
 Coding items and services,
 Billing activities, and
 Completing your timecard.
If you are involved in any of these activities (even if you do not
prepare a bill or claim yourself) you need to exercise care to ensure
the accuracy of the claims DHS submits.
10.1 Accurate Claims – Scenario
Consider the following discussion between Chen, a medical records
coder, and Gloria, his co-worker, during lunch.
Chen: I’m so frustrated! I can’t get Dr. Jones to respond to my
questions about one of his charts, and the timeframe to
complete the bill is almost up. I’ve tried to contact him a
couple of times and he hasn’t called me back.
Gloria: Why do you need to speak to him?
Chen: I can’t tell the diagnosis from the chart. I’ve narrowed it
down to one of two diagnoses, but I need some additional
information from him to be sure which one it is.
Gloria: Maybe you need to call his Department Chair.
Chen: He IS the Department Chair!
Gloria: Oh boy, that’s a tough one.
Chen: I guess I’ll have to flip a coin. Head is diagnosis A, tail is
diagnosis B. Here goes.
Chen: Okay, heads, it’s diagnosis A.
Gloria: You’re not serious?
Chen: You bet I am. What else can I do?
COMPLIANCE AWARENESS TRAINING
___________________________________________________________________
16
Gloria Well, you know that’s against our policy, but I won’t say
anything because I can tell you’re stuck.
Stop for a minute and analyze the situation.
How do you think Chen should have handled the situation?
What about Gloria, what do you think she should do?
10.2 Accurate Claims – Analysis
This case raises the question of an employee’s obligation to ensure
that claims-related information is accurate. Even though Chen may
feel like he has no choice, he must not accept the Department Chair’s
non-response and guess at the correct coding. Chen is responsible for
accurately coding the medical records, and must continue to pursue
the information needed. Just because someone is in a management
position does not mean that they are exempt from following the rules.
In fact, managers are expected to set the example of appropriate
behavior. If Chen does not feel comfortable going above a Department
Chair, he should talk with his supervisor and get assistance. The
supervisor may want to take the issue to the Medical Director. In any
case, the claim cannot be submitted unless it is accurate and
supported with appropriate documentation.
Is it okay for Gloria to ignore the situation? No. Hopefully Gloria can
convince Chen that he cannot take a chance on miscoding a record
and offer him advice on how he can proceed. However, if Chen insists
on guessing at the correct diagnosis, Gloria must report it to her
supervisor or use any of the other reporting options discussed.
11 Records Integrity
All business data, records, and reports must be accurate. This includes
medical, financial and non-financial records. Examples of non-
medical/non-financial records where accuracy is important are
attendance records, licensing information, certifications, and workload
statistics.
COMPLIANCE AWARENESS TRAINING
___________________________________________________________________
17
Our records must be available to support our business practices and
actions. Business records include paper documents, computer-based
information, and any other information about DHS or its activities.
In addition, the form and content must comply with applicable rules,
regulations, and DHS policies.
11.1 Patient’s Chart – Scenario
Consider the following exchange between Kim, a nurse, and Rudy, a
resident physician, who is rushing out of the hospital at 4:00 pm.
Rudy: Hey Kim, I forgot to write an order for a chest x-ray for the
patient in 201B. Would you please make a note in the chart
and sign my name? Also, time it for 3:00 p.m. – I don’t want
my attending to know that I forgot to do it earlier. Go ahead
and make the arrangements for the x-ray. Thanks!
Kim: But…
Stop for a minute and analyze the situation, then read about what Kim
should do.
11.2 Patient’s Chart – Analysis
All documentation in the medical records must be accurate, timely,
and complete, as mandated by regulatory, accreditation, and
professional standards. Kim cannot sign another individual’s
name or indicate an earlier time. This information would not be
accurate and is not allowed.
Dr. Rudy has asked Kim to accept a verbal order. Policies regarding
verbal orders vary between DHS facilities, and in some cases are not
allowed except in emergencies. If necessary, refer to your facility’s
policies. However, the important point in this example is that
information in the medical record must ALWAYS be accurate,
timely, and complete.
Kim should discuss this with her supervisor or use any of the other
reporting resources discussed in this training.
COMPLIANCE AWARENESS TRAINING

12 Cost Reports
DHS submits cost data for payment under government programs. It is
our responsibility to make cost reports as accurate and complete as
possible. In addition to financial information, other information impacts
the accuracy of our cost reports, including, but not limited to:
 Attendance records,
 Patient and payer statistics,
 Workload statistics in ancillary departments,
 Workload statistics in support services like housekeeping and
dietary, and
 Equipment location records.
Every individual needs to ensure that his or her input into these
records/statistics is complete and correct.
13 Workplace Conduct
13.1 Health and Safety
DHS has policies to protect our workforce, patients, and visitors from
potential hazards. Managers and supervisors must ensure that all
workforce members receive proper training in healthy and safe work
practices.
Tell your supervisor or local Safety Officer of any workplace injury or
potentially dangerous situation so that corrective action may be taken.
COMPLIANCE AWARENESS TRAINING
___________________________________________________________________
19
The Department’s goal is to provide a safe and appropriate
environment for everyone.
13.2 Harassment
DHS has a NO TOLERANCE POLICY on harassment. All workforce
members have the right to work in an environment free of
harassment. Be sure to watch your own conduct and be sensitive to
how it will be seen or experienced by others.
Harassment is not limited to sexual harassment or bigotry. It also
includes degrading or humiliating remarks, jokes, or slurs; sexual
comments, actions, or touching; and workplace violence.
13.3 Reporting Workplace Misconduct
Report if you observe or experience:
 Harassment or violence
 Use of alcohol or illegal drugs or misuse of prescription drugs
 Improper use or distribution of drugs from DHS
 Any other improper conduct
You can report any of these incidents to your supervisor, Human
Resources, a member of the management, your Local Compliance
Officer, or the Compliance Hotline. Be sure to report it — DHS can only
fix problems that we are aware of.
14 Licenses, Certifications, and Other
Credentials
Those in positions that require professional licenses, certifications, or
credentials are responsible for maintaining these in an active and
current status. You are not permitted to work without valid, current
licenses or credentials if your position requires them. Moreover, you
must comply at all times with applicable federal and State
requirements associated with those licenses, certificates or credentials.
COMPLIANCE AWARENESS TRAINING
___________________________________________________________________
20
15 Excluded or Suspended Individuals or
Entities
DHS will not knowingly employ, contract with, or purchase from
individuals or entities that are suspended or excluded from
participation in federal healthcare programs. An individual or entity
may become “excluded” for various reasons, ranging from the
conviction of a healthcare related fraud to failure to pay a health
education loan. Regardless of the reason, DHS cannot receive
reimbursement from Medi-Cal, Medicare, or other federal healthcare
programs for services provided by or ordered by an individual/entity
that is suspended or excluded.
DHS checks the exclusion or suspended status of workforce members,
contractors and vendors prior to entering into employment or
contractual relationships, and annually thereafter. In addition, all
workforce members must report to their supervisor or Local
Compliance Officer if they become subject to suspension or exclusion,
or if they become aware that another employee or contractor has
become subject to suspension or exclusion.
16 Patient Confidentiality
DHS collects and maintains various personal information (medical,
financial, etc.) about our patients, and must ensure that the
confidentiality of this information is protected.
DHS has developed policies and procedures to ensure compliance with
the federal HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules and State privacy
requirements. The basic purpose of these privacy rules is to protect
the privacy of every patient’s health information. The basic purpose of
the HIPAA Security Rule is to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and
security of electronic health information. In both cases, patient health
information can only be shared under specific circumstances.
Breaches of patient privacy have serious implications for DHS and you,
as an individual. Under recently enacted state legislation, DHS
hospitals must notify the State and the affected individual where there
is an unauthorized disclosure of confidential patient data. The State
may then impose fines.
COMPLIANCE AWARENESS TRAINING
___________________________________________________________________
21
All workforce members should have received training on the patient
privacy and security rules. If you have not received this training, you
should notify your supervisor.
16.1 HIPAA – Scenario
Below is a conversation between Steve, a Patient Financial Services
Worker, and Sandra, a nurse.
Steve: Hi Sandra. I heard that my supervisor, Lou, was admitted
last night.
Sandra: Hi Steve, how are you?
Steve: I’m fine, but what’s going on with Lou? Our manager
wouldn’t tell us anything.
Sandra: I’m sorry, but you know I can’t tell you anything more than
that he is stable.
Steve: Hey, I think I’ve worked here long enough to get the inside
scoop. Come on, he’s my supervisor and friend. I just want
to know if there’s anything I can do.
Let’s stop for a minute and think about Steve’s behavior. How do you
think he should behave? Did Sandra do the right thing?
16.2 HIPAA – Analysis
Under both HIPAA and California’s privacy laws, workforce
members have a responsibility to protect confidential patient
information. The HIPAA Privacy Standards apply to health
information that is written, spoken, electronic, or communicated and
maintained in any other form. As a general rule, without the patient’s
consent, protected health information should only be disclosed to
those who need it to provide and/or pay for treatment or care, or for
healthcare operations.
Since Steve’s function does not require him to have Lou’s health
information, and assuming Lou has not authorized the release of this
information, Sandra did the right thing by not disclosing it. Of course,
Lou may choose to tell his co-workers about his condition or tell his
COMPLIANCE AWARENESS TRAINING
___________________________________________________________________
22
senior staff to share the information. While confidential information
was not disclosed, Steve attempted to obtain information that he was
not entitled to. Therefore, Sandra should remind Steve of the
requirement to protect the privacy of patient health information at all
times and discuss this situation with her supervisor, who may
determine that further action is needed.
17 Conflict of Interest
A conflict of interest arises when a workforce member has a motivation
(such as a financial or personal interest) or responsibilities that would
or could interfere with his/her ability to make decisions or judgments
solely in the best interest of DHS or its patients. Conflicts of interest
may include, but are not limited to, relationships, associations, or
business dealings with contractors, vendors, suppliers, other
healthcare organizations, or individuals. The conflict can arise because
of the workforce member’s own relationships or finances, or because
of the relationships or finances of an immediate family member, such
as a wife or child.
• Workforce members are prohibited both by law and DHS policy
from participating in making governmental decisions in which
they have a conflict of interest.
• Workforce members are prohibited from attempting to use their
official position to attempt to influence a governmental decision
in which they have a conflict of interest.
• Workforce members must conduct their affairs in a manner that
avoids conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of
interest.
• Workforce members must report any conflicts of interest to their
supervisors, as required by the Department’s Conflict of Interest
policy. Employees must fill out a disclosure form annually and
as conflicts of interest arise.
Participating in a governmental decision in which you or your
immediate family member has a conflict includes participating in any
aspect of the contracting process including recommending whether to
contract out work, drafting specifications, evaluating proposals (even if
COMPLIANCE AWARENESS TRAINING
___________________________________________________________________
23
you are not the final decision maker), monitoring the contract or
recommending termination.
Participation in a contract by a person with a conflict of interest can
result in the contract being void (i.e. not binding on the County) and
may have other serious consequences.
17.1 Gifts
Generally, workforce members may not accept any gifts from, or give
any gifts to, individuals or organizations that have a business
relationship with DHS. This is to avoid the appearance of favoritism
toward a contractor, vendor, healthcare provider, or others.
An unsolicited gift of little value from a vendor, contractor or health
care provider may be accepted on an occasional basis, such as during
the holidays, only if the gift is perishable, for example, flowers or
candy, and is intended for a division or group. You may never accept
or give cash or cash equivalents, such as gift certificates.
Generally, gifts from patients or persons on behalf of patients to
individual workforce members should not be accepted. If the patient
insists, unsolicited gifts of little or no monetary value may be accepted
so long as acceptance of the gift does not influence the timeliness and
quality of care, treatment or services.
DHS workforce members must never use gifts or other incentives to
improperly influence business relationships or outcomes.
18 Outside Employment
While County employees are permitted to have jobs outside of County
hours, there are limits on the circumstances under which such
employment can occur. County employees are not permitted to
participate in outside employment activities which are inconsistent
with their County position. Activities are inconsistent with County
employment if:
COMPLIANCE AWARENESS TRAINING
___________________________________________________________________
24
 they impair the employee's efficiency in County service;
 they create a direct conflict, such as when someone is employed
by an entity that also performs services for the County, or
requires the use of County tools or property;
 the hours of the outside employment require the employee to be
on duty all night before coming into his or her County position
the next morning, or require the employee to perform outside
services during their County work hours.
Even compatible outside employment is limited to 24 hours per week
except for postgraduate physicians.
If employees wish to engage in outside employment, they must
complete an outside employment form, and obtain prior approval from
their supervisor and their division head (or the next highest level of
supervisor.) In addition, each employee must complete a disclosure
form annually.
19 Patient Referrals
DHS has two primary and strict rules for patient referrals:
(1) We do not pay or offer to pay for referrals.
(2) We do not accept or ask for payments for referrals that we
make.
Payment includes any form of compensation, not just money.
Accordingly, we may not accept items such as trips, the promise of
future business, tickets to sporting events, etc.
19.1 Patient Referral Practices
Federal and State anti-kickback laws strictly prohibit payments that
are designed to induce the referral of patients or other healthcare
business such as the ordering or purchasing of goods or services that
go into patient care.
COMPLIANCE AWARENESS TRAINING
___________________________________________________________________
25
Federal and State anti-referral laws limit the situations in which a
physician who has a financial relationship with a healthcare provider
can order services.
The goal of these laws is to ensure that financial considerations do not
affect patient care decisions.
Violation of the anti-kickback rules is considered a felony, and may
have serious consequences for the individuals involved and for the
County. These consequences potentially include civil and criminal fines
and penalties. These fines can be as high as $50,000 per payment
received or offered. These actions can also lead to exclusion from
participation in federally funded healthcare programs.
19.2 Patient Referral - Scenario
Below is a conversation between two social workers during their break.
Wally: Guess where I’m going on Friday night?
Sara: Where?
Wally: To the Music Center for the final performance of the
Phantom of the Opera.
Sara: Wow! How’d you get those tickets? I heard they were almost
impossible to get, and expensive, too.
Wally: You know Mrs. Smith, the Nursing Home Administrator from
Greenville who is always bugging us about sending them
more patients? Well, she had two tickets that someone gave
to her and she couldn’t use them.
Sara: You know you can’t accept those tickets.
Wally: Well, I figured since the tickets didn’t cost her anything, it
wasn’t really a gift. I could see that it would be a problem if
she handed over $400 in cash to me, but this is different.
Plus, I haven’t recommended her facility to anyone for
weeks, and I didn’t promise to send her anyone.
Do you think Wally should accept those tickets?
What should Sara do?
COMPLIANCE AWARENESS TRAINING
___________________________________________________________________
26
19.3 Patient Referral – Analysis
Workforce members may not accept any personal gifts from, or give
any gifts to, individuals or entities that do business with or are seeking
to do business with DHS.
Gifts can be seen as an inducement for the referral of patients or as an
attempt to influence a decision to purchase County goods or services.
Therefore, serious consequences could result from the acceptance of
gifts. Wally must not accept the theater tickets.
It doesn’t matter that the Nursing Home Administrator didn’t pay for
the tickets or that Wally didn’t promise to recommend her facility. If
Wally doesn’t return the tickets, Sara must report the situation to her
supervisor or use one of the other reporting options.
19.4 Stark II
Stark II is a federal anti-referral law that prohibits healthcare entities
from billing Medicare for certain services referred by a physician to an
entity with which the physician or his or her ‘immediate family’ has a
direct or indirect ‘financial relationship,’ unless a specific exception
applies. The referral for services is also prohibited. DHS would be
subject to significant fines for violations of this law.
COMPLIANCE AWARENESS TRAINING
___________________________________________________________________
27
20 Contractor Relationships
DHS intends to manage its contractor relationships in a fair and
reasonable manner, consistent with all applicable laws and good
business practices.
The selection of contractors or vendors will be made based on specific
criteria, such as quality, technical excellence, price and service.
Purchasing decisions must never be made based on personal
relationships or friendships.
20.1 Contractor Relationship – Scenario
Consider the following discussion between Diana, the Dietary Manager,
and Tom, from Contracts and Grants:
Diana: Hey, Tom! It’s almost time to receive the bids for our dietary
contract, right?
Tom: That’s right. They’re due next month.
Diana: You know, our current vendor, Mr. Phelps, is great to work
with and his staff does a fantastic job. We don’t really want
to have to start all over with a new contractor. You know
what a pain that can be. What can I tell him that would help
him put together the winning proposal?
Tom: Everything he needs to know is in the Request For Proposal
(RFP).
Diana: Come on, help me out here. It really would be to everyone’s
benefit if we stuck with the same contractor. These guys are
great and we don’t want to cause any disruptions in service.
It’s our patients who would suffer. Just a few hints?
Tom: Like I said, everything any of the bidders needs to know is in
the RFP.
Let’s stop for a minute and analyze the situation.
Did Tom do the right thing?
20.2 Contractor Relationship – Analysis
To maintain the integrity of the bidding process, all potential bidders
must be provided with the same information regarding the requested
services. No one can be given an unfair advantage by having exclusive
COMPLIANCE AWARENESS TRAINING
___________________________________________________________________
28
information. Thus, Tom acted correctly in refusing to provide "insider"
information.
While Diana feels that a change in the contractor would result in a
disruption of services, County rules require that all potential bidders be
given an equal opportunity. The objective of the bidding process is to
obtain the best services at the best price. We must always follow the
highest ethical standards in all purchasing activities. Tom should report
this situation to his supervisor or use any of the other reporting
options discussed.
21 Purchasing Practices
Per Federal and State law, you cannot pay or receive payment to
arrange for the purchase of healthcare goods or services. This includes
a reduced price or free services for County indigents, in exchange for
paying or ordering goods at full price for Medi-Cal patients or
beneficiaries of other federal healthcare programs. These activities
can result in the same penalties as paying for referrals. There are
exceptions that allow discounts and other pricing deals, but you need
to be cautious.
22 Governmental/Regulatory Reviews
During governmental or regulatory reviews and inspections, such as
billing inquiries or accreditation reviews, you are required to provide
complete and accurate information based on the facts as they are
understood at the time. We are expected to be cooperative and
courteous to the auditors during the review process.
COMPLIANCE AWARENESS TRAINING
___________________________________________________________________
29
Workforce members shall NOT:
• Conceal, destroy, or alter any potentially relevant documents,
• Make false or misleading statements, or
• Attempt to cause another person to fail to provide accurate and
timely information.
23 Final Thoughts
We are all responsible for ensuring ethical and legal conduct. If
something doesn’t seem right, take action! Ask questions and report
your concerns. Make sure your behavior is consistent with the
principles expressed in Code of Conduct. Also, remember to review
new policies and procedures and apply them to your job.
You should now be ready to complete the attached assessment.
