1. INTRODUCTION :
1.1 Scope of the Study
This study deals with an important aspect of Indian federalism, namely, the concurrent powers of
legislation under the Constitution. The subject of federalism in any country covers a vast area,
embracing legislative, executive and judicial powers, as distributed between the federal union and
its units. Distribution of legislative power is only one branch of the subject; and in that branch, the
topic of concurrent legislative power is only a sub-branch (so to say).
1.2 Importance of the subject
(a) Nevertheless, the subject has its own theoretical and practical importance.
Theoretically, the subject carries an appeal, because (i) it represents the vesting of power
in two parallel legislatures, operating at the same time and (ii) also because such a
scheme is to be found in most federations of the world, though the details vary.
(b) The practical importance of the Concurrent list, (when adopted in any federation) lies in
the fact, that the vesting of the same type of power in two parallel agencies carries, within
it, the seeds of a possible conflict. This implies, that the Constitution (of the country
concerned) should provide, in advance, a mechanism for resolving such conflict. In India,
article 254 of the Constitution primarily seeks to incorporate such a mechanism.
1.3 Scheme of discussion
In this short paper, it is proposed, to deal, first, with the general scheme of distribution of
legislative powers under the Indian Constitution; next, to state, in brief, the main principles for the
interpretation of legislative entries; and thereafter, to focus on the various entries in the
Concurrent list itself, concentrating on their rationale. It will then be possible to formulate the
questions that can possibly arise on the present scheme.
2. DISTRIBUTION OF LEGISLATIVE POWERS
UNDER THE INDIAN CONSTITUTION :
2.1 Legislative powers in the federation
The essence of federalism lies in the sharing of legal sovereignty by the Union and the federating
units. And, in general, the most precise way of demarcating the respective areas of the federation
and federating units is to demarcate their respective areas in regard to legislation. There are
many reasons for this; but the two most important, are the following:
(a) Demarcation of legislative power helps in defining boundaries the of the executive
power also, as usually the former controls the latter.
(b) It is easier to verbally formulate, with reasonable precision, the various topics on which
the legislative power can be exercised, as the legal system of a country would usually
have had occasion to deal with the topic in some form or other – say, by or through
proposals for legislation, actual legislation, academic or (occasionally), in political
debates or academic discussions. In other words, the topics would (in many cases) have
a ring of familiarity for the practising or academic lawyer.
2.2 The scheme of distribution in India (articles 245-246)
(a) The constitutional provisions in India on the subject of distribution of legislative powers
between the Union and the States are spread out over several articles (articles 245-254).
However, the most important of those provisions – i.e, the basic one – is that contained in
articles 245-246.
Article 245 provides, inter alia, that (subject to the provisions of the Constitution).
(i) Parliament may make laws for the whole or any part of the territory of India and
(ii) the legislature of a State may make laws for the whole or any part of the State.
(b) Thus, article 245 sets out the limits of the legislative powers of the Union and the States
from the geographical (or territorial) angle. From the point of view of the subject matter of
legislation, it is article 246 which is important. Article 246 reads as under:
“246(1) Notwithstanding anything in clauses (2) and (3), Parliament has exclusive
power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List 1 of
the Seventh Schedule (in this Constitution, referred to as the “Union List”).
(2) Notwithstanding anything in clause (3), Parliament, and subject to clause (1),
the Legislature of any State also, shall have power to make laws with respect to
any of the matters enumerated in List III in the Seventh Schedule (in this
Constitution, referred to as the “Concurrent List”).
(3) Subject to clauses (1) and (2), the Legislature of any State has exclusive power
to make laws for such State or any part thereof with respect to any of the
matters enumerated in List II in the Seventh Schedule (in this Constitution,
referred to as the “State List”).
(4) Parliament has power to make laws with respect to any matter for any part of
the territory of India not included in a State, notwithstanding that such matter is a
matter enumerated in the State List”.
2.3 Article 254 – repugnancy
Since the Concurrent List[1] – article 246 (2) – gives power to two legislatures, a conflict can arise
between laws passed on the same subject by the two legislatures. To deal with this situation,
article 254 of the Constitution makes the following provision:
“254(1) If any provision of a law made by the Legislature of a State is repugnant to any
provision of a law made by Parliament which Parliament is competent to enact, or to
any provision of an existing law with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the
Concurrent List, then, subject to the provisions of clause (2), the law made by
Parliament, whether passed before or after the law made by the Legislature of such
State, or, as the case may be, the existing law, shall prevail and the law made by the
Legislature of the State shall, to the extent of the repugnancy, be void.
(2) Where a law made by the Legislature of a State with respect to one of the matters
enumerated in the Concurrent List contains any provision is repugnant to the
provisions of an earlier law made by Parliament or an existing law with respect to that
matter, then, the law so made by the Legislature of such State shall, if it has been
reserved for the consideration of the President and has received his assent, prevail in
the State:
Provided that nothing in this clause shall prevent Parliament from enacting at any
time any law with respect to the same matter, including a law adding to, amending,
varying or repealing the law so made by the Legislature of the State.”
2.4 Judicial decisions (repugnancy)
Repugnancy has been explained in many judicial decisions. Important amongst these, are the
following:
(i) Zaverbhai Vs. State of Bombay, AIR 1954 SC 752 (Implied repeal – Essential Supplies
Act)
(ii) Tika Ramji Vs. State of UP, (1956) SCR 393; AIR 1956 SC 676. (U.P. Sugar Cane Act,
etc.).
(iii) Ahmedabad Mill Owners’ Association Vs. I.G., AIR 1967 SC 1091.
(iv) Karunanidhi Vs. Union of India, AIR 1979 SC 898; (1979) Cri LJ 773: Karunanidhi Vs.
Union of India, (1979) Cri LJ 1876 (Mad) (FB).
(v) Raghubir Vs. State of Haryana, AIR 1981 SC 2037.
(vi) Western Coalfields Vs. Special Area Development, AIR 1982 SC 697.
2.5 Union and State legislation
(a) The co-existence of Central and State laws in a particular area can give rise to litigation.
Such problems arise, either because the Union or a State may illegally encroach upon the
province of the other (parallel) legislature, or they may arise because (though there is no
encroachment, as such, on each other’s sphere), the two laws clash with each other.
(b) The two situations are, strictly speaking, different from each other; and they must be judged
by two different tests. Where the subject-matter of the legislation in question falls within either
the Union List or the State list only, then the question is to be decided with reference to
legislative competence. One of the two laws must necessarily be void, because (leaving
aside matters in the Concurrent List), the Indian Constitution confers exclusive
jurisdiction upon Parliament for matters in the Union List and upon a State Legislature for
matters in the State List.[2] The correct doctrine applicable in such cases is that of ultra
vires. Since one of the two laws must be void, the question of inconsistency between the two
has no relevance. Only one law will survive; and the other law will not survive, because ex
hypothesi, it has no life.
(c) In contrast, where the legislation passed by the Union and the State is on a subject matter
included in the Concurrent List, then the matter cannot be determined by applying the test
of ultra vires because the hypothesis is, that both the laws are (apart from repugnancy),
constitutionally valid. In such a case, the test to be adopted will be that of repugnancy, under
article 254(2), of the Constitution.[3]
(d) It follows, that it is only where the legislation is on a matter in the Concurrent List, that it
would be relevant to apply the test of repugnancy. Notwithstanding the contrary view
expressed in some quarters, this appears to be the correct position. Such a view was
expressed by Dr. D. Basu in his Commentary on the Constitution of India (1950) 1st edition,
page 564, and it is this view, that seems to have been upheld (impliedly) by the Supreme
Court in the under - mentioned decisions: -
(i) Deep Chand Vs. State of U. P., AIR 1959 SC 648; (1959) Suppl. 2 SCR 8.
(ii) Premnath Vs. State of J&K, AIR 1959 SC 749 (1959) Suppl 2 SCR 270.

(v) Barani Vs. Henry, AIR 1983 SC 150, paragraph 15.
(vi) Hoechst Pharmaceuticals Vs. State of Bihar, AIR 1983 SC 1020, paragraphs 68, 69 and
76 (Full decisoon of the position).
(vii) Pochanna Lingappa Vs. State of Maharashtra, AIR 1985 SC 389, paragraph 26; (1985)
1 SCC 425.

section 107, Government of India Act, 1935 see Lakhi Narayan Das vs. Province of
Bihar, AIR 1950 FC 59.
2.6 Article 255
Notice should also be taken of article 255 of the Constitution, quoted below:
“255. Requirements as to recommendations and previous sanctions to be regarded as matters of
procedure only.-
No Act of Parliament or of the Legislature of a State, and no provision in any such Act, shall be
invalid by reason only that some recommendation or previous sanction required by this
Constitution was not given, if assent to that Act was given -
(a) where the recommendation was that of the Governor, either by the Governor or by the
President;
(b) where the recommendation required was that of the Rajpramukh, either by the
Rajpramukh or by the President;
(c) where the recommendation or previous sanction required was that of the President, by
the President. “
[See Jawaharmal Vs. State of Rajasthan, AIR 1966 SC 764, 769, 790: (1966) 1 SCR
890].
3. INTERPRETATION OF LEGISLATIVE ENTRIES :
3.1 Determination of nature of legislation
It is obvious, that where either the Union or the State legislature proposes to enact a law, it must,
in the first place, decide whether it has legislative competence with reference to the subject
matter of the law. For this purpose, the draftsman will necessarily have to examine whether the
subject matter falls within the relevant list, that is to say:
(a) the Union List or the Concurrent list (for the draftsman in the Union) or
(b) the State List (for the draftsman in the State).
3.2 Doctrine of pith and substance
For this purpose, the test of “pith and substance” is usually applied. In no field of constitutional
law is the comparative approach more useful, than in regard to the doctrine of “pith and
substance”. This is a doctrine which has come to be accepted in India and derives its genesis
from the approach adopted by the courts (including the Privy Council), in dealing with
controversies arising in other federations. Briefly stated, what the doctrine means, is this. Where
the question arises of determining whether a particular law relates to a particular subject
(mentioned in one List or another), the court looks to the substance of the matter. Thus, if the
substance falls within Union List, then the incidental encroachment by the law on the State List
does not make it invalid.
3.3 Decisions
The principle of “pith and substance” had come to be established by the Privy Council, when it
determined appeals from Canada or Australia involving the question of legislative competence of
the federation or the States in those countries. In India, the doctrine of pith and substance came
to be adopted in the pre-independence period, under the Government of India Act, 1935. The
classical example is the Privy Council decision in Prafulla Vs. Bank of Commerce, AIR 1946 PC
60, holding that a State law, dealing with money lending (a State subject), is not invalid, merely
because it incidentally affects promissory notes (See now Union List, entry 46). The doctrine is
sometimes expressed in terms of ascertaining the “nature and true character of legislation”; and it
is also emphasized, that the name given by the Legislature (to the legislation) in the short title, is
immaterial. Again, for applying the “pith and substance” doctrine, regard is to be had (i) to the
enactment as a whole, (ii) to its main objects, and (iii) to the scope and effect of its provisions.
The under mentioned decisions illustrate the above proposition:-
(i) State of Rajasthan Vs. G. Chawla, AIR 1959 SC 544, 547 (Ancillary matters).
(ii) Southern Pharmaceuticals Vs. State of Kerala, AIR 1981 1865, paragraph 15 (incidental
encroachment, to be disregarded).
(iii) Prem Vs. Chhabra, (1984) 2 SCC 302, paragraph 8.
4. RATIONALE OF THE SCHEME OF DISTRIBUTION OF POWERS :
4.1 Four salient features
Four salient features mark the scheme of distribution of legislative powers under the Indian
Constitution.
(1) There is a three-fold distribution of legislative power-represented by three lists – Union,
State and Concurrent.
(2) The supremacy of federal laws is maintained in two situations (which are the principal
situations of practical importance):
(a) in determining the extent of legislative power of the federation and the units, (if
a doubt arises as to the list in which a particular subject of legislation falls,
the non obstante clause in article 246 achieves federal supremacy);
(b) in determining the question whether a federal law will prevail or a State law will
prevail; (if both have an impact on a particular human activity, and are in conflict
with each other, then the federal law prevails).
(3) If a particular topic does not find an express mention in the three legislative lists, then
the power to legislate thereon (i.e., the residuary law-making power) is vested in the
federation.
(4) In certain situations (even apart from emergencies), the federation may come to be
vested with legislative power, even on state subjects.
[Mr. Justice, E. S. Venkataramiah and P. M. Bakshi, Indian Federalism (1992), pages 72-73, para
7.1].
4.2 Genesis in the 1935 Act: Joint Select Committee Report
(a) At this stage, it seems necessary to mention, that the entire scheme of distribution of
legislative powers under the present Indian Constitution is based on the Government of
India Act 1935.
(b) Further, so far as the Concurrent List is concerned, it is desirable to quote what the Joint
Committee on Indian Constitutional Reforms said, with reference to the corresponding
list, as contemplated in the proposals that led to the Act of 1935 :-
[Joint Committee on Indian Constitutional Reforms (1934) pages 30-31, para 51, quoted
in Mr. Justice E. S. Venkataramiah and P. M. Bakshi, Indian Federalism(1992) page 85
para 7.13].
“Experience has shown, both in India and elsewhere, that there are certain matters which
cannot be allocated exclusively either to a central or to a Provincial legislature and for
which, though it is often desirable that provincial legislation should make provision, it is
equally necessary that the central legislature should also have a legislative jurisdiction
enable it, in somes cases to secure uniformity in the main principles of law throughout the
country, in others, to guide and encourage provincial effort and in others, again, to
provide remedies for mischief arising in the provincial sphere, but extending, or liable to
extend beyond the boundaries of a single province”.
4.3 Uniformity
The above enunciation by the Joint Select Committee[4] was not intended to be exhaustive.
Nevertheless, it would be convenient to give sere some concrete examples of the three main
objectives of a Concurrent List as envisaged by the Joint Select Committee.
Take, first, the aspect of uniformity in the main principles of law. This consideration accounts for
the following entries in the Concurrent List in the present Indian Constitution.
Entry 1. Criminal law………..
Entry 2. Criminal Procedure ……..
Entry 5. Marriage and divorce etc.
Entry 7. Transfer of property other than agricultural land
Entry 8. Registration of deeds and documents
Entry 9 Actionable wrongs
Entry 10. Bankruptcy and insolvency
Entry 11. Trusts and trustees
Entry 12. Administrator’s general and official trustees
Entry 12A. Administration of justice etc. (inserted in 1976)
Entry 13. Evidence etc.
Entry 14. Civil procedure etc.
Entry 15. Contempt of court etc.
Entry 16. Lunacy etc.
Entry 28 Charities etc.
4.4 Encouraging local effort
The Joint Select Committee also stressed the need to “guide and encourage provincial effort”.
This consideration forms the background and rationale for several legislative measures enacted
in India, wherein the Union has laid down the policy and guidelines, – thereby promoting further
efforts by the States. The following can be regarded as examples of such approach.
(a) The Probation of Offenders Act, 1958.
(b) The Family Courts Act, 1984.
(c) The Consumer Protection Act, 1986.
(d) The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.
4.5 Problems extending beyond the State
Finally, as envisaged by the Joint Select Committee[5] on Indian Constitutional reforms, some
entries in the Concurrent List take into account the fact, that (in future), a need may arise to enact
legislation providing for mischief’s arising in the provincial sphere, which extend, (or are likely) to
extend, beyond the boundaries of a single province. Examples of entries in the Concurrent List,
which illustrate this consideration, are the following:
Entry 3. Preventive detention
Entry 5. Marriage etc.
Entry 15. Vagrancy; nomadic and migratory tribes
Entry 21. Commercial and industrial monopolies, etc.
Entry 25. Education, including Universities, etc.
(This entry was revised in 1977).
Entry 33. Trade and commerce etc. in certain products and goods.
Entry 35. Mechanically propelled vehicles etc.
Entry 38. Electricity
Incidentally, the wisdom of including “Electricity” in the Concurrent List (entry 38) is amply
demonstrated by the successive statutory measures enacted on the subject in India after
independence beginning with the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948, supplemented or modified by a
mass of recent legislation in the subject.
5. POST CONSTITUTION AMENDMENTS :
5.1 Significance of the amendments
After the commencement of the Constitution, several amendments of the Constitution, relevant to
the Concurrent List, have been passed. In this short Chapter, it is proposed to discuss a few of
them, in order to explore how far these amendments bring out the function and importance of the
Concurrent List.
5.2 Chart of amendments
In order to make the discussion concrete, a chart of post 1950 amendments which are relevant to
the entries in the Concurrent List has been prepared and is presented below :-

5.2 Transfer from State List
It will be seen from the above Chart, [6] that on a fairly large number of occasions in the past, it
became necessary to amend the Constitution, by transferring, to the Concurrent List, certain
matters from the State List. Obviously, it was thought that the matters in question were not being
adequately dealt with (or could not be adequately dealt with) by the Sates [Entries 11A, 13A, 17B,
25 and 33A].
5.3 New Entries
(a) Changed conditions – political social or economic – may necessitate the insertion of new
entries in a legislative list. When such a situation arises, the concrete question that may fall to be
considered is, whether the addition should be made in the Union List or in the State List or in the
Concurrent List.
(b) Precisely such a question seems to have arisen, after it became apparent, that the problem
of population explosion might need specific legislative sanction, for enacting into law the policy to
be adopted on the subject. The relevant amendment was made in 1976, by introducing, in the
Concurrent List, a new entry 20A – relating to “population” and family planning. Presumably, it
was considered that instead of the Union undertaking the exclusive responsibility of promoting
legislation on the subject, it would be better to give the power to the Centre as well as to the
States. As a result, entry 20A was inserted in the Concurrent list. There seems also to have been
a thinking, that though the subject was of national importance, yet there might be occasions for
State-wise variations in legislative policy.
(c) In any case, the insertion of any new entry in a legislative list -whether Concurrent List or
any other list – illustrates the validity of the proposition, that no draftsman can visualise all
possible future contingencies and fully encapsulate them in a supposedly exhaustive linguistic
formula.
(d) Incidentally, reverting to the specific topic of “population and family planning”, long before
entry 20A was inserted in the Concurrent List, Parliament had already enacted the Medical
Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971, apparently by recourse to Concurrent List, entry 1, “Criminal
law”. In effect, the Act substantially modifies the rigorous operation of sections 312 – 316 of the
Indian Penal Code (relating to causing miscarriage and its aggravations and variations).
5.4 Minor amendments in there Concurrent List
The other amendments, effected in the Concurrent List, analysed in the Chart given above, are of

TYPES OF LEGISLATIVE DOCUMENTS
MEASURES (BILLS, ETC.)
Bill: a basic legislative vehicle introduced by a member. Designated first by chamber (House
or Senate) and then by sequential number. S indicates Senate and HR indicates House of
Representatives (NOT House Report). May become law.
Joint Resolution: very much like a bill but encountered less frequently. Designated first by
originating chamber (with a J to indicate joint) and then by sequential number, e.g., H.J. Res.
516. May become law.
Resolution (also called Simple Resolution): measure concerning only a single chamber generally
expressing a consensus of opinion regarding a particular issue (e.g., Congressional pay,
daylight-saving time, deployment of U.S. troops overseas, etc.) or legislative housekeeping.
The housekeeping function is particularly important in the House, as rules governing
debate in this chamber are issued as resolutions. Furthermore, the reports accompanying
these rules may contain the text of amendments that will subsequently be voted upon.
Designated by chamber and then by sequential number (S. Res or H. Res.), simple
resolutions do not become law.
Concurrent Resolution: measure concerning both chambers. Infrequently encountered,
concurrent resolutions do not become law. However, the legislative translation of the
President’s budget is always a concurrent resolution (e.g., H. Con. Res. 64/S. Con. Res. 18).
Even though a concurrent resolution does not become law and is therefore not binding, it may
well go through the entire legislative process save the final steps concerned with enactment.
N.B.: As bills and joint resolutions may become law, they are also subject to Presidential veto.
If not enacted into law by the end of a Congress, a measure may be reintroduced during
succeeding Congresses. In such cases, its number is not necessarily the same (e.g., the Family
and Medical Leave Act in the 102d Congress, H.R. 770, was introduced in the 103d Congress as
H.R. 1), but the language, sponsor, and title are often nearly identical to the preceding
version(s).
HEARINGS
Hearings are the public’s chance to comment on legislation, matters of Congressional responsibility
and/or pressing public interest. Not all hearings are published. Moreover, there is usually a delay of 3-
18 months after a hearing takes place until is actually printed by the Government Printing Office.
Printed hearings may also contain the text of “materials submitted for the record” by
persons/organizations who did not actually testify. Note that hearings are not verbatim transcripts
of testimony/questions & answers: witnesses have the opportunity to make “technical corrections” to
their remarks, which may well involve wholesale deletions and changes.
TYPES OF LEGISLATIVE DOCUMENTS (cont’d)
-2-
COMMITTEE PRINTS
Prints are the miscellany and ephemera of legislative documents. A committee may issue a print as to
assist in the consideration of legislation or in the performance of other committee business. Prints may
be study reports done by outside consultants for the committee or the result of research done by
committee staff or by the CRS (Congressional Research Service) on the committee’s behalf..
Committee prints may also be compilations of laws under the committee’s jurisdiction
reprinted as they currently stand or even legislative histories of selected laws compiled by the
House’s Office of the Legislative Counsel or less often, by the committee staff. Finally, from
time to time, a manager’s draft bill or amendment to be marked-up (revised in committee) are also
called committee prints, but they are not generally published by GPO or given a committee print
number.
COMMITTEE REPORTS
Reports are committee analyses and recommendations regarding legislation. The committee report is
a goldmine for legislative history research in that it often sets out in detail the purpose of a
given bill, its prior history, and the reasons why the statutory language is worded in a
particular way. Note that if the subject matter of a bill falls within the jurisdiction of more than one
committee, more than one report may be issued. Depending upon the circumstances, these publications
may be different freestanding reports each with its own number, or different parts of the same report.
FLOOR DEBATE
While not freestanding documents, debate is the near verbatim record of consideration of legislation on
the floor of each chamber and is published in the Congressional Record (or its predecessors).
Mixed in with the evidence of members’ concerns on legislation are often amendments: their efforts
to change the legislative language. Though not all amendments are printed in full in the
Congressional Record, many are, especially in the Senate. Floor debate, especially the
consideration of a conference report, is another good, often underutilized source of legislative
history.
CONFERENCE REPORTS
Most bills do not go to conference; differences between the House and Senate versions are usually
reconciled when one chamber accepts the other chamber’s language. In more difficult cases, a measure
may be passed in one chamber, sent to the other and amended, sent back to the first chamber and
amended yet again and vice versa a few more times until one side finds the other’s legislative language
acceptable. Only in the rare cases when the House and Senate cannot reconcile the differences
TYPES OF LEGISLATIVE DOCUMENTS (cont’d)
-3-
between their respective versions of the same bill does a conference occur. Conference committees,
temporary committees composed of selected members from both chambers to deal only with a single bill
(vs. House/Senate/Joint committees), arrive at compromise language. The language is then included in a
conference report with explanation and analysis which refer to the previous versions of the bill, usually on
a section-by-section basis. A description of the reasoning underlying the compromise version is included.
The conference report is an excellent starting point for legislative history research. Unlike
committee reports, conference reports are always printed in the Congressional Record (House
Section), often before they are available elsewhere. Next, BOTH chambers must consider and pass
the conference report for the bill to become a law (occasionally conference reports do not pass!).
PUBLIC LAWS
More than 10,000 bills are usually introduced each Congress. Of these, only 600 or so are enacted into
law. In such instances, each law is assigned a number, which is preceded by the number of the Congress,
e.g., P.L. 109-8, the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, is the eighth
public law enacted during the 109th Congress. Public laws are published first in stand-alone pamphlet form
as slip laws and then compiled annually into the United States Statutes at Large.

GOVERNMENT OF INDIA DECISIONS
Government of India's Decisions under Rule 2:
1. The Government of India have held that a cadre post as defined in the Rules
means only the post specified under item 1 of the cadre strength of each State. A
non-cadre post does not become a cadre post simply, on being declared equivalent to a
cadre post. It would become a cadre post only after it has been included in and
specified as such item 1 of the cadre strength of each State as shown in the Schedule to
the I.A.S. ( Fixation of Cadre Strength) Regulations, 1955.
[G.I M.H.A. letter No. 14/51/65-AIS(III), dated 21-2-1966].
Government of India's Decisions under Rule 4:
1.1. The criterion for inclusion of senior duty posts in the IAS cadre schedule is
that the cadre should include all posts for which the State Government would require
officers with wide administrative experience of the standard of the I.A.S. It should thus
include:
(i) all superior administrative posts of and above rank of District Officers e.g.
Collectors, Commissioners, Members of Board of Revenue, Secretaries & Deputy
Secretaries in Administrative Departments; and
(ii) a proportion of miscellaneous posts including those of Heads of Departments.
Strict uniformity in this matter is difficult.
1.2 The Central Government reserves the right to take a final decision regarding
inclusion of a post in the cadre.
[ G.I., MHA letter No. 5/61/57-AIS (II), dated 22-11-1957, No. 27/28/64-AIS (III),
dated 24-3-1966 and 14/39/65-AIS (III).]
2. Posts included in the Cadre acquire the character of permanency.
[G.I., MHA letter No. 6/25/64-AIS(I), dated 1-6-1964].
3. Temporary additions to or subtractions from a cadre are not to be taken into
account for cadre calculations or for calculating the number of selection grade posts.
[G.I. MHA letter No. 5/24/58-AIS-II dated 5.5.1958]
8
4.1 The second proviso requires that the posts added temporarily to the cadre
should carry duties and responsibilities of a like nature of cadre posts. The exercise of
this power by the State Government with reference to a post involves an objective
assessment of the nature of the duties and responsibilities attached to that post in
comparison to those attached to a cadre post. Thus posts cannot be added temporarily
to the cadre unless such posts already exist in the cadre.
4.2. The scale of pay of the post, temporarily added to the cadre, should also be
the same as that of the cadre post to which it corresponds. Thus, where the pay of the
post of Secretary in the cadre is in the senior time-scale, it would not be in order, to add
temporarily to the cadre post of Secretary in the super time-scale.
[G.I., MHA letter No. 6/9/63-AIS(I), dated 9-2-1965].
5.1. A doubt was raised whether ex-cadre posts equated to cadre posts under
rule 9 of any Rules would be treated as automatic temporary additions to the cadre
and would fall within the scope of the second proviso to rule 4(2) of the Cadre Rules.
5.2. Both these provisions are independent of each other and are not
inter-connected. The second proviso to rule 4(2) of the Cadre Rules empowers the
State Governments to make temporary additions to the cadre for the period not
exceeding the limit indicated therein. Rule 9 of the Pay Rules, on the other hand,
provides for regulation of pay of cadre officers appointed to non-cadre (ex-cadre) posts.
The State Governments are competent to appoint cadre officers to such posts under
their control to the extent that the appointments should not exceed the number of
posts in the deputation reserve of the State cadre. The non-cadre (ex-cadre) posts to
which cadre officers are appointed would not result in the posts becoming temporary
additions to the cadre within the scope of the second proviso to rule 4(2) of the Cadre
Rules.
[G.I., MHA letter No. 6/25/65-AIS(I), dated 24-4-1965].
6.1. The Government of India have clarified the scope of the second proviso to
Rule 4(2) of the IAS (Cadre) Rules, 1954, as follows:-
6.2. The provision regarding addition of extra cadre posts for short periods did
not exist in the ICS/IP Cadre Rules, nor did it exist in the Indian Civil Administrative
Cadre Rule, 1950 or the Indian Police Cadre Rules, 1950. Even the original draft of
the present IAS/IPS Cadre Rules did not contain such proviso. It was only in the Chief
Secretaries' Conference held in 1954 to consider the drafts of the various All India
Services Rules & Regulations, that the question of making such a provision in the Cadre
Rules, was raised by the Government of West Bengal. The discussion which took place
in the Conference on this question indicates clearly the scope of this provision in the
Cadre Rules. The relevant extracts from the proceedings of the meeting of the
Conference, held on 13th April, 1954, are reproduced below:-
West Bengal - In the rule regarding the alteration of strength, have to make the
same point that I raised this morning. The State Government should have the
power to make temporary additions to the cadre for a period not exceeding one
9
year, when the duties of the posts are closely analogous to those of the scheduled
cadre posts. This would be necessary, if suddenly we feel the necessity to
increase the number of say, the Superintendents of Police.
Shri Bapat - I think that will be a useful provision. We can have it.
Shri Dutt - Please let us have a draft. Of course, there is the obligation of posting
only a cadre officer to such a post.
6.3. It would appear from the above discussion that the provision was made to
meet the sudden and immediate need for extra posts carrying duties or
responsibilities analogous to cadre posts subject to the condition that such posts will be
held by cadre officers only. In actual practice occasions for resorting to this provision will
be rare and ordinarily the need for such extra cadre post is not for a period exceeding
one year. If the need for such extra cadre posts is for a period exceeding one year
generally the need is considered to be a permanent one unless the State Governments
are certain that they will not need such posts beyond a particular fixed period not
exceeding three years in all. Therefore, steps should be taken for the inclusion of
such posts in the permanent cadre on the expiry of one year. The idea is that by
including such posts in the permanent cadre, the State Government will be able to
assess correctly their needs for recruitment on the basis of the competitive
examination.
6.4. If no cadre officer is available, a temporary post created with whatever
designation, should not be added to the IAS/IPS cadre. If the post is held by a State
Civil/Police Service Officer whether in the Select List or not, it will be a temporary
addition to the State Civil/Police cadre of the State or an ex-cadre post counted
against deputation reserve, if any, provided in the cadre or it would be an isolated post
in the State Civil/Police Service to which the State Civil/Police Service Officers could be
appointed with the approval of the State Public Service Commission, if so required
by the State Rules.
[G.I., MHA letter No. 14/53/65-AIS(III), dated 21-3-1966].
7. It has been held that State Government are not competent to exceed the
number of posts specified against items 2 and ♦5 to 8 of the cadre schedules without the
prior sanction of the Central Government under rule 4(2) of the proviso there to.
[G.I. MHA letter No. 14/51/66-AIS(III), dated 21-2-1966 and file No.
14/14/65-AIS(II)].
8.1. A question was raised whether posts temporarily added to the IAS/IPS cadre
of a State under the second proviso to Rule 4(2) of the IAS/IPS (Cadre) Rules, 1954,
should be deemed to have been included temporarily in schedule III-A or III-B to the
IAS/IPS (Pay) Rules, 1954.
8.2. The legal position in respect of the posts temporarily added to the IAS/IPS
Cadre has been clarified in the Ministry of Home Affairs letter No. 14/51/66-AIS(II) dated
♦ at present items 3,4, & 6.
10
21 st February 1966 and 14/53/65-AIS(III), dated the 21 st March, 1966. It would appear
therefrom that a post temporarily added to the cadre is not a ‘cadre post’ as defined in
the IAS/IPS (Cadre) Rules, 1965. It is also not a cadre post for the purposes of IAS/IPS
(Fixation of Cadre Strength) Regulations, 1955. An extra post (carrying duties and
responsibilities analogous to cadre posts) could be temporarily added to the cadre, when
a cadre officer is available to man such posts. If no cadre officer is available, a
temporary post created with whatever designation when held by a State Civil/Police
Service officer whether in the Select List or not, would be a temporary addition to the
State Civil/Police Service cadre of the State of an ex-cadre post counted against
deputation reserve, if any, provided in that cadre or it may be an isolated post in the
State Civil/Police Service. If would have no connection whatsoever with the IAS/IPS
cadre of the State.
8.3 When a post temporarily added to the IAS/IPS cadre is held by a cadre officer
a declaration of equivalence under Rule 9 of the IAS/IPS (Pay) Rules, 1954, will not be
necessary for the purpose of fixation of his pay under the IAS/IPS (Pay) Rules, 1954, the
duties and responsibilities of such post being already analogous to a cadre post vide the
second proviso to rule 4(2) of the IAS/IPS (Cadre), Rules, 1954.
[G.I., MHA letter No. 15/39/66-AIS(III), dated 22-4-1966].
9.1. The Government of India have clarified that purely temporary post may be
divided into two categories- (i) Posts created to perform the ordinary work for which
permanent cadre posts in the IAS/IPS cadre already exist, the only distinction being
that the new posts are temporary and not permanent and (ii) isolated posts created for
the performance of special tasks unconnected with the ordinary work which the Service
is called upon to perform. An example of the latter type of post would be a post on a
Commission of Enquiry. A distinction by strict verbal definition is difficult but in practice
there should be little difficulty in applying the distinction in individual cases. The
former class of posts should be considered to be temporary additions to the Cadre of
the Service. The second proviso to rule 4(2) of the IAS/IPS (Cadre) Rules, 1954, gives
power to the State Government concerned to add for a period not exceeding one year,
and with the approval of the Central Government for a further period not exceeding two
years, to a State Cadre, one or two posts carrying duties or responsibilities of a like
nature to cadre posts. The latter class of temporary post should be considered as
unclassified and isolated ex-cadre post, the power to create such post will depend on
the provisions contained in the Book of Financial Powers of the State Government
concerned.
9.2. The posts which are temporary additions to the IAS/IPS Cadre are to be
created when cadre officers are available to man them, otherwise, these should be
temporary additions of the cadre to which the holders of the post belong as clarified
in Ministry of Home Affairs No. 15/39/66-AIS(III), dated 22-4-1966.
9.3. The posts which are ex-cadre of IAS/IPS Cadre are to be manned by
cadre officers and counted against deputation reserve provided in the Cadre. There
is restriction on the powers of the State Government for the creation of such posts as
the number of such posts is not to exceed the number shown against deputation
reserve in the Cadre. If a member of service is not going to be appointed to an
ex-cadre post, the temporary post can be created either as an ex-cadre post of the State
11
Civil/Police Service or just an ad-hoc post without equivalence as clarified in paras 6-9
of Ministry of Home Affairs' D.O. letter No. 27/28/64-AIS(III), dated 24-3-1966. It would,
however, be appropriate that when the temporary post is to be held by a State
Civil/Police Service Officer, it should be created in the time-scale of the State
Civil/Police Service.
[G.I. MHA letter No. 40/5/66-AIS(III). dated 27-12-1966].
Government of India Instructions under Rule 4:
1.1. The Government of India have clarified certain fundamentals regarding the
management of the All India Services cadres, as follows:
1.2. At the time of the constitution of the IAS/IPS in 1947, it was decided to
include the following categories of posts in the IAS cadre:-
(a) All superior posts in the administrative departments of and above the rank of
District Officers, i.e., Collectors, Commissioners, Members, Board of Revenue,
Secretaries, Deputy Secretaries, etc.
(b) A proportion of miscellaneous posts including those of Heads of
Departments.
In the IPS, corresponding ranks were substituted, the principle remaining the same.
Provision was made in the rules for ♠triennial review of the cadre strength to adjust it
according to the growing and changing needs of each State.
1.3. The senior posts as notified in the schedule of each State cadre were
divided into three main categories, viz:-
(a) Senior posts under the State Government;
(b) Central Deputation Reserve;
(c) Deputation Reserve.
The other categories and reserves, such as leave and training reserves and the
junior posts are ancillary to the three main categories described above.
1.4. Posts that fulfill the qualifications described in 1.2 above should therefore,
be enumerated as the senior posts under the State Government. The intention also
has always been that all posts in the State which are required on a long term basis and
which carry duties and responsibilities similar to such senior cadre posts, should be
included in the cadre. At the time of the ♠triennial review a realistic estimate should
be made of the new posts required during the next 4 to 6 years on the basis of the
previous rate of expansion of the cadre and of the additional posts required in
connection with the Five Year Plans and the growing business of Government and the
cadre strength should be fixed after taking these needs into consideration.
♠ Now quinquennial
12
1.5. The Central Deputation Quota fixes the share of the Government of
India out of the State cadre for the various requirements of the Centre. By and large
this quota may be taken to be the limit of deputation to the Government of India.
1.6. The Deputation Reserve is intended to provide a cushion to the State
Government for its temporary and unforeseen demands of cadre officers for manning
such ex-cadre posts which are required temporarily for short periods and which do
not qualify for inclusion in the IAS cadre. The very name suggests that it is intended to
cover short-term needs; long-term posts being brought into the cadre as soon as it is
known that they would continue over a period of time.
1.7. Select Lists are intended to provide a ready list of screened State Service
officers who can be appointed to vacancies that may occur in the promotion quota during
a particular year. It can also be utilized to fill short-term vacancies and to meet any
minor emergency requirement on a temporary basis. It has never been intended to
become a parallel cadre for manning long-term vacancies either in the cadre or in
ex-cadre equivalent posts.
1.8. If the cadre strength is adequately fixed keeping in view the normal rate of
growth of the cadre and the requirements of the Plan etc. and if recruitment to the
cadre has been on an adequate scale, the need for filling cadre posts by Select List
Officers should rarely arise. There should be no long term ex-cadre posts. If there are
any, they ought to go into the cadre. For short term ex-cadre posts, the deputation
reserve in the cadre should be adequate. If there is an imbalance between the number
of the ex-cadre posts and the deputation reserve, it can be redressed either by
reducing the number of ex-cadre posts or increasing the deputation reserve.
1.9. It is not at all necessary that new senior posts which are created must be
declared equivalent to cadre posts. Rule 9(1) of the Indian Administrative Service (Pay)
Rules, 1954, requires that members of the service should not be appointed to an
ex-cadre post unless the State Government had declared it equivalent to a cadre post.
In exceptional circumstances, of course for reasons to be recorded in writing, the
equation may not be made [Sub-rule(4) of rule 9 of IAS(Pay) Rules]. It is, therefore,
only when a member of the service is to be appointed to an ex-cadre post and it has to
be declared equivalent to a cadre post and even then it is not necessary in all cases. If
a member of the service is not going to be appointed to an ex-cadre post, declaration
of equivalence is not required at all. These can be created either as ex-cadre posts of
the State Civil or Police Services or just ad hoc posts without equivalence.
1.10. The adequacy of recruitment rate for the all India Services is vital to the
proper functioning and management of Government. Two measures are needed to
ensure this. The first is the prompt encadrement of new posts likely to last over an
extended period and the second is to assess future needs in advance on the basis of
the past experience and the future plans. A failure in either of the two requirements will
affect the adequacy of cadre strength thus leading to strains and stresses which some
of the States are facing today.
1.11. Once the cadre strength has been determined at the triennial review, which
can be made more frequent if required, the rate of annual recruitment must be
13
adequate to fill up all the posts within two or three years. In some of the States the
recruitment rate has been rather low with the result that gaps continue in the cadre for
years and longer Select Lists are required to meet the cadre shortages. This has
two-fold disadvantages; it affects the seniority of the direct recruits and the State
Service officers develop hopes and expectations beyond those provided for in the
scheme of the All India services.
[G.I,. M.H.A. D.O. letter No. 27/28/64-AIS(III), dated 24-3-1966.]
2.1 State Governments while framing the rules for setting up of Tribunals etc.
under various Acts, make provision that the Chairman/Members of Tribunal shall be a
member of the IAS equivalent in status and rank to a specified cadre post in the IAS
cadre of that State. As a consequence, it becomes obligatory to encadre such posts at
the prescribed levels.
2.2. In order to ensure uniformity of approach and to avoid inter-cadre imbalances
which might result as a consequence of posts being encadred in the manner indicated
above, the State Governments are requested to obtain the prior concurrence of this
Department before making any provision in the statutory rules for filling up certain posts
by the members of the IAS.
[G.I., DOPT Letter No. 11031/6/87-AIS(II), dated 20.4.1987.]
3. The question whether the posts in Public Sector Undertakings could be
encadred in the AIS has been examined further and the Government of India have been
advised that such posts cannot be encadred in the cadre schedules of the All India
Services as cadre posts.
[G.I., DOPT Letter No. 11031/18/88-AIS(II), dated 8.12.1988.]
4.1. The Government of India have issued the following clarifications regarding
rule 4 of the Cadre Rules and the various reserves against which officers holding posts
other than cadre posts are to be shown:-
4.2. Under Rule 3 of the Cadre Rules, Cadres have been constituted for each
State or group of States. The strength and composition of each of these cadres have
been determined by the Regulations, framed under the Cadre Rules and have been
shown in the Schedule to those Regulations. The term ‘cadre post’ has been defined as
any post specified under item 1 of each cadre in the Cadre Schedule vide clause (b) of
Rule 2 of the Cadre Rules.
4.3. The power to alter the strength and composition of a cadre vests in the
Central Government, vide Sub-rule (1) of Rule 4 of the Cadre Rules. With a view to
meeting emergent needs of the State administration, the State Government concerned
has been authorised vide the second proviso under sub-rule (2) of Rule 4 of the Cadre
Rules, to add for a period not exceeding one year to a State Cadre, one or more posts
carrying duties or responsibilities of like nature to cadre posts. However, the posts so
added by State Government do not become cadre posts.
4.4. With a view to ensuring that the members of the Indian Administrative Service
14
are not deployed on posts which do not require to be manned by officers of that caliber,
it has been provided, vide sub-rule (1) of Rule 9 of the Indian Administrative Service
(Pay) Rules, 1954 (hereinafter referred to as “The Pay Rules”) that no such members
shall be appointed to a post other than a post specified in the Schedule III to these
Rules hereinafter referred to as the “Pay Schedule”) unless a declaration is made that
the said post is equivalent in status the Pay Schedule. However, for the sufficient
reasons to be recorded in writing, such a declaration may be dispensed with, vide sub-
rule (4) of Rule 9 of the Pay Rules.
4.5. Neither a post which is declared equivalent in status and responsibility to a
post included in the Pay Schedule nor a post in respect of which such declaration has
been dispensed with, is a cadre post.
4.6. Powers under the second proviso under sub-rule (2) of Rule 4 of the Cadre
Rules are to be invoked only for increasing the number of posts with a particular
designation already included in the Cadre Schedule. If a post with a particular
designation does not figure in the Cadre Schedule, it cannot be created by invoking
these powers. It will have to be created, where necessary, by the State Government,
under their inherent powers and if a member of the Indian Administrative Service is to be
appointed thereto such appointment should be regulated under rule 9 of the Pay Rules.
4.7. When a post is created by invoking the powers under the second proviso to
sub-rule (2) of Rule 4 of the Cadre Rules, further action under Rule 9 of the Pay Rules,
is not necessary, because the post will already be figuring in the Pay Schedule.
4.8. Thus, powers under sub-rule (2) of Rule (4) of the Cadre Rules and under
Rule 9 of the Pay Rules, are mutually exclusively and together are exhaustive, in so far
as posts under the State Government are concerned.
[G.I., DP&AR letter no, 4/12/70-AIS(I) dated 26.5.71 – remaining part superseded by
Government of India Instruction No. 6 quoted below]
5.1. The Government of India have issued the following clarifications
regarding the composition of the Central and State Deputation Reserves:-
5.2. Under second proviso to sub-rule 2 of Rule 4 of the Cadre Rules, the State
Government is competent to add for a period not exceeding one year and, with the
approval of the Central Government, for a further period not exceeding two years, to a
State or Joint Cadre one or more posts, carrying duties or responsibilities of a like nature
to cadre posts. Doubts have been raised whether such posts are to be considered as
cadre posts or as ex-cadre posts against the State Deputation Reserve. It is hereby
clarified that the posts which are created in exercise of the powers of the State
Governments under the second proviso under sub-rule 2 of rule 4 of the Cadre Rules are
to be counted as temporary cadre posts added temporarily to the Cadre Schedule and
as such, they are not to be counted against the State Deputation Reserve. However,
only such posts which are created for increasing the number of posts with a particular
designation already included in the Cadre Schedule would be counted in this category.
5.3. On the other hand, if a post with a particular designation does not figure in the
Cadre Schedule, it cannot be created by invoking this power. It can be created as per
15
necessity by the State Government under their inherent powers and the members of the
All India Services cannot be deployed to such a post unless a declaration is made that
the post is equal in status and responsibility to a post mentioned in Schedule III to the
respective Pay Rules under sub-rule 1 of rule 9 of the same Rules. However, for
sufficient reasons to be recorded in writing such a declaration may be dispensed with
vide sub-rule 4 of rule 9 of the respective Pay Rules.
5.4. Neither a post which is declared equivalent in status and responsibility to a
post included in the pay schedule, nor a post in respect of which such a declaration has
been dispensed with, is a cadre post. Such a post is to be counted against the State
Deputation Reserve. Apart from these posts, the other kinds of posts which are to be
counted against the State Deputation Reserve are as follows:-

6. Copy of the letter no. 11033/1/98-AIS(II) of Government of India, Ministry of
Personnel, P.G. & Pensions (Department of Personnel & Training ) addressed to the
Chief Secretaries of All States/UTS clarifying composition of Central and State
Deputation Reserve – Clarification regarding.
6.1. Reference is invited to this Department’s letter of even number dated
24.3.1998 and 6.8.99 and letter no. 11031/19/75-AIS(II), dated 16.4.1975 as well as
letter no. 4/12/70-AIS(I) of DP&AR dated 26.5.1971. In respect of the composition of the
State deputation Reserve and the Central Deputation Reserve, the matter has been
further considered in this Department and it has been decided that this will comprise
different components as described below:
(i) The State Deputation Reserve will comprise the following:-
(a) All ex-cadre posts held by cadre officers under the control of the State
Government including those on inter-cadre deputation to another State Government.
(b) All posts under a Company, Association or a body of individuals, whether
incorporated or not, which is wholly or substantially owned or controlled by the State.
(c) All posts under a Municipal Corporation or Local Body under the control of the
State Government.
6.2. The Central Deputation will comprise the following:-
All posts held by the All India Services officers under the control of the Central
Government including posts under a company, association or body of individuals,
whether incorporated or not, which is wholly or substantially owned or controlled by
the Central Government and all posts under Rule 6(2)(ii) of the IAS/IPS/IFS (Cadre)
Rules, i.e. the posts in an international organisation, an autonomous body not
controlled by the Government or private body.

6.3. To this extent, the orders of Government of India vide DOP&AR letter no.
4/12/70-AIS(I), dated 26.5.1971 stand modified.
[G.I. DOPT letter No. 11033/1/98-AIS(II), dated 13.06.2000.]
7.1. A question was raised as to how the scale check prescribed in MHA
endorsement No. 14/51/65-AIS(III),dated 21-2-1966 should be conducted. The
Government of India have considered the matter carefully and they have decided that
the scale check in respect of the IAS/IPS cadre of each State should be carried out by
the Accountant General concerned with reference to the IAS/IPS (Fixation of Cadre
Strength ) Regulations, 1955, in relation to each State. In other words it should be
examined whether the posts shown against each item have been properly utilised. It is
also to be checked up whether any of the cadre posts is held by a non-cadre officer and
if so whether it is with proper approval of the competent authority under rule 9 of
the IAS/IPS (Cadre ) Rule, 1954, and whether non-cadre officers (Select List Officers)
have been appointed to officiate in cadre posts in the order in which their names
appear in the current Select List.
7.2. The intention is that the quarterly check should be conducted for the quarters
ending 31 st March, 30 th June, 30 th September and 31 st December and the results
should be communicated by the Accountant General concerned to the Government of
India as also the State Government concerned within one mouth i.e. the report for the
quarter ending 31st March should be communicated by the 30th April, and so on.
7.3. The Government of India have also decided that copies of the current Select
List and the orders issued under rule 9 of the IAS/IPS (Cadre) Rules, 1954, from time to
time should be supplied to the Accountants General to enable them to carry out the
above-mentioned scale check. They will, no doubt, treat the Select Lists as
confidential documents and utilise them for official use only, as required under the
existing instructions.
[G.I., MHA letter No. 16/5/66-AIS(III), dated 23-6-1966].
8. Rule 4 of the Cadre Rules provides for a review of the strength and
composition of the cadre at the interval of every three years. The State Governments
are, therefore, requested to sponsor their ♠triennial review proposals after taking into
consideration their requirements at least for ♠3 years to avoid frequent proposals for
amendments to the cadre schedule. However, cases where changes in the cadre are
considered unavoidable and cannot be delayed till the next triennial review, in such
circumstances proposals may be made once in a year i.e. in the month of January.
The State Governments are therefore, requested to adhere to this procedure for
proposing amendments to the cadre schedule.
[G.I. MHA letter No. 6/10/68-AIS(II), dated 27-2-1968].
9. Letter to the Chief Secretaries of all States on fixation of norms for conducting
review of cadre strength and composition of the State cadres of Indian Administrative
♠ Now quinquennial
17
Service.
9.1 The issues pertaining to fixation of norms for conducting review of cadre
strength and composition of the state cadres of Indian Administrative Service had been
under consideration in this Department for quite some time.
9.2 The need for fixing the norms for All India Services had arisen due to the
concerns of cadre management given in the age profile of IAS officers and bulge in the
cadre structure for officers between the ages of 45-60 years and the need for parity in
career prospects between States. Balanced cadre structures and regular promotion
prospects will help overall cadre management.
9.3 Formulation of norms would help streamline this process over time. The Fifth
Central Pay Commission Report has recommended a 30% reduction in the authorized
strength of the All India Services both at the Centre and at the State. The Commission
has highlighted the demoralizing effect of creation of unnecessary posts both in the
Centre and at the State and surrendering unnecessary posts and has recommended
selectivity in promotion and fast track promotions. A streamlined IAS Cadre is desirable
and will help management of the cadre. The norms which are adopted will be reviewed
every five years. Fixing of norms of cadre strength will allow for flexibility within the
overall ceiling will help improve the situation. A pyramidical structure with minimum ratio
between higher and lower level is desirable for parity and balanced cadre structure.
9.4 A copy of the norms/ guidelines for IAS prepared by this Department was
sent to the State Government vide letter of even number dated the 17th July, 2003 for
obtaining their views/comments by the 11 th August, 2003. This was followed by a number
of reminders.
9.5 Based on the responses received from the State Governments, it has been
decided to adopt the following norms while conducting the review of cadre strength and
composition of the State cadres of Indian Administrative Service:
(i) The total cadre strength will not normally be allowed to increase in any state.
The number of junior posts (including leave reserve) should be 16.5%of the
SDP. The level of recruitment should be pegged between 2.75-3.25% of the
SDP every year.
(ii) The break-up of the cadre posts should be approximately as given in the
following table:-
S.No. Level/Scale in SDP % of Posts
1. Rs. 26,000/- (fixed) 2.0%
2. ASTS 8.0%
3. STS 30.0%
4. Selection Scale 25.0%
5. Senior Scale/JAG 35.0%
(iii) The State Governments may have the flexibility of adjusting the number of
Senior and Selection Scale posts subject to the condition that the total
percentage of these posts will not exceed 60%.
18
(iv) The State Governments may also have the flexibility to create ex-cadre posts
subject to the following:-
1) The number of ex-cadre posts at the Rs. 26,000(fixed) grade will not exceed
the number of cadre posts.
2) The total number of persons on ex-cadre posts and Central Deputation shall
not exceed the CDR +SDR for the State. (This has been superseded vide
DOPT letter No.20011/1/2005-AIS-II dated 23.01.2008, which is given in the
IAS (Pay) Rules, 2007, under Government of India decision.)
3) While the State will need to define the ex-cadre posts at the time of the cadre
review, they may at their discretion change the designations/posts up to 15%
of the designated posts.
9.6 The above norms/guidelines will be followed while considering the proposals
of review of the strength and composition of State Cadre of Indian Administrative
Services and other cadre matters. The State Governments are requested that the cadre
review proposals may be prepared keeping in view the above norms/guidelines.
[G.I. DOPT letter No.11033/3/2002-AIS-II, dated 27.01.2005]
Government of India's Decisions under Rule 5:
1. It has been decided that, while allocating candidates selected on the basis of
the annual competitive examinations to the various State Cadres, the recommendation
of the States Reorganisation Commission, that at least 50 per cent of the new
entrants in any state cadre should be from outside the State concerned, shall be borne in
mind.
[G.I MHA File No. 1/66/50-AIS(I).]
Government of India's Decisions under Rule 6:
1. The terms of deputation of a cadre officer deputed to another State shall be
finalised by the borrowing Government in consultation with the lending Government. If
there is any point of difference between them, it may be referred to the Government of
India.
[G.I., MHA Letter No. 22/6/57-AIS(II), dated 30.5.1957.]
2. The terms of deputation of an officer, deputed on foreign Service are normally
issued by the lending authority, in consultation with the borrowing authority. In the case
of the All India Services, however, the All India Services (Leave) Rules, 1955, the All
India Services (Conduct) Rules, 1968 and the All India Services (Discipline and
Appeal) Rules, 1969 provide that a member of an All India Services whose services
are placed at the disposal of a company, corporation etc. by the Central Government or
the Government of a State shall, for the purpose of these rules, be deemed to be a
member of the Service serving in connection with the affairs of the Union or in
connection with the affairs of that State, as the case may be. By virtue of the provision
contained in these rules, if the terms of deputation of a member of an All India Service
deputed to a public sector undertaking controlled by the Central Government, are
19
issued by a State Government, `Government' in his case will be a State Government
concerned. It is, however, only proper that such a member of an All India Service
should be under the control of the Central Government for the purposes of these
Rules. In view of this, the terms of deputation of a member of an All-India Service who
is serving in connection with the affairs of a State and who is deputed to a public sector
undertaking etc. controlled by the Central Government should be issued by the
Ministry/Department of the Central Government which is administratively concerned
with that organization in consultation with the State Government of Joint Cadre Authority
on whose cadre the officer is borne.
[G.I. DOPT Letter No. 13/27/74-AIS(II), dated 17.1.1975.(the relevant portion only)]
3.1. Rule 6(2)(ii) of the IAS(Cadre) Rules, 1954 and corresponding rules
governing the Indian Police Service and Indian Forest Service enables deputation of a
member of the service to a non-Government body by the Central Government in
consultation with the State Governments concerned.
3.2. The Rajya Sabha Committee on Subordinate Legislation in their 93rd report
has observed that members of the All India Service should be deputed to such bodies
only in exceptional circumstances for reasons to be recorded in writing. The above
observations of the Rajya Sabha Committee may be kept in mind while recommending
the deputation of members of All India Service to non-Government bodies.
[G.I., DOPT Letter No. 28020/4/91-AIS-II dated 26.7.1993.]
4.1. Rule 6(2)(ii) of the IAS(Cadre) Rules and the corresponding rules governing
the IPS and IFS enable the deputation of a member of the Service to an international
organisation, an autonomous body not controlled by Government or a private body, etc.
In such cases, the Central Government is the authority competent to order such
deputation and the consent of the State Government and the officer concerned is also
required.
4.2. It is seen that in several instances officers of the All India Services are
required to be sent on deputation to the Universities/teaching or training
institutions of repute which are autonomous organisations and which are not
controlled by the Government, and therefore, such deputations fall within the purview
of Rule 6(2)(ii). It has now been decided that in all such cases, the State Government
may themselves order the deputations in institutions located within the State, for a
period of upto three years, provided that prior consent of the officer is obtained and the
Central Government is kept informed of all such deputations. This provision will not
apply to deputations to Central Universities/Deemed Universities or institutions
established by the Government of India.
4.3. In regard to the question of the `cooling-off' period required to be
completed by an officer who was on Central deputation before being eligible to be
deputed to a body referred to under Rule 6(2)(ii), presently there are no such
requirements of a `cooling-off' period. However, in order to ensure that officers at the
end of Central deputation return to serve their States, it has been decided that all such
officers will be required to `cool-off' in their States at the end of their period of Central
deputation before they can be considered for deputation under Rule 6(2)(ii) if their
20
place of posting is located outside their own allotted States.
[G.I. DOPT Letter No. 14017/16/91-AIS-II dated 13.10.1993.]
5. II. GUIDELINES FOR DEPUTATION OF MEMBERS OF THE ALL

(ii) Financial Autonomy – Organisations with less than 50% share
of government funding or organisations where Government is
not a majority shareholder.
(iii) Power to give directions Organisations over which the
Government has no power to give directions. The nature of
byelaws and the power to guide would be important, for
example, in the case of the Food Corporation of India (FCI).
Organisations where Government officials hold ex officio
positions cannot be considered as autonomous
2. Deputations to the international agencies shall be regulated in terms of Consolidated
Instructions on Foreign Assignments issued from time to time.
3. The inclusion of organisations under the Registrations of Companies Act may be
examined separately.

deputation.
6. FCRA clearance shall be required for deputation to an organisation receiving foreign

22
IPS officers, MOEF in the case of IfoS officers. This approval is a precondition for the cases
being placed in the Committee detailed in Para 8 below. In the case of IAS officers serving in the
Government of India, since the Committee at Para 8 below also includes Secretary(P) the
proposals would directly be placed before the Committee.
8. A Committee under the Chairmanship of Cabinet Secretary comprising Secretary(P),
Finance Secretary may be set up to screen, on a case to case basis, applications/requests seeking
deputation under 6(2)(ii). For officers below the Joint Secretary level to Government of India,

This distinction between international organizations and other national organizations under Rule
6(2)(ii) may be modified in this respect also.

away from his cadre for long stretches at a time, there shall be no objection if an officer
on central deputation is permitted deputation under Rule 6(2)(ii) to the limit of approved
Central Deputation tenure without cooling off.

Guidelines.
(Instructions issued vide DOPT’s letter no. 14017/33/2005-AIS(II)(Pt.I) dated the 14 th
March, 2008)
Government of India's Decisions under Rule 9:
1. One of the objects of the procedure laid down in this rule is to ensure that a
non-cadre officer is not appointed to a cadre post, if a suitable cadre officer is available.
Thus, while the suitability of an officer included in the Select List for officiation in a
cadre post cannot ordinarily be in doubt, the question to be examined in making all
appointments to cadre posts is whether a suitable cadre officer is available or not, vide
sub-rules (3) and (4). It has, therefore, been decided that even in a case where an
officer included in the Select List is appointed in an officiating capacity to a cadre
post, the requirements of this rule should be fully complied with.
[G.I., MHA letter No. 9/30/62-AIS(I), dated 31.8.1962.]
2. As the filling of a cadre post by a non-cadre officer is permitted under rule
9, it has been held that it would be within its scope if a non-cadre officer, while holding
a non-cadre post in addition discharges the duties and functions of a cadre post.
Such arrangements should not, however, last for more than three months.
[G.I. MHA letter No. 6/17/64-AIS-(I), dated 8.4.1965.]
3.1 The Government of India have been advised that while making temporary
appointments of Select List officers to cadre posts under rule 9 of the Cadre Rules, the
order in which their names appear on the Select List should be followed. Where
administrative needs so require, a State Civil Service Officer may be appointed
temporarily to a cadre post out of turn for a period not exceeding three months to the
extent permitted by rule 9 of the Cadre Rules. If the out of turn officiation of Select
List officer exceeds the period of three months it would be incumbent on the part of
the Central Government to refuse the continuance of the Select List officer in such
temporary officiation, and to require that the post be filled by the Select list officer who is
not in order in the Select List. It is also open to the Central Government under rule 9
of the Cadre Rules to give directions for the appointment of a cadre officer to a cadre
post in place of , or instead of, a Select List officer.
37
3.2. It was further being held that no benefit in the matter of seniority, pay and
probation will be admissible to a Select List officer appointed to a cadre post out of
turn beyond the period of three months from the date of temporary appointment.
[G.I. MHA letter No. 14/51/65-AIS(III) dated 21.2.1966].
4. The Government of India have held that it is ultra vires of the All-India
Services Act, 1951, to regulate appointments of non-cadre officers (whether in the
Select List or not) in non-cadre posts (whether declared equivalent to a cadre post or
not) under Rule 9 of the Cadre Rules. Consequently, there is no question of
approval of the Government of India being accorded in the case of a Select List Officer
holding a non-cadre post or a post temporarily added to the cadre, under rule 9 of the
Cadre Rules.
[G.I., MHA letter No. 15/79/69-AIS(III), dated 17.10.1966.]
Government of India's Instructions under Rule 9:
1.1. The Government of India have advised the State Governments that they
should keep in view the legal position explained in the note appended to the Ministry of
Home Affairs letter No. 14/51/65 AIS(II), dated 21-2-1966 regarding the scope of
regulation 8 of the I.A.S. (Appointment by Promotion) Regulation, 1955, and rule 9 of
the I.A.S. (Cadre) Rules, 1954, while appointing non-cadre officers (Select List officers)
to officiate in cadre posts.

[G.I.,MHA letter No. 6/54/64-AIS(I), dated 26.3.1966.]
2.1. The Government of India have clarified the scope of Rule 9 of the Cadre
Rules as follows:-
(a) The report under sub-rule (2) of rule 9 of the I.A.S./I.P.S. (Cadre) Rules,
1954, is to be made when a non-cadre officer is appointed to a cadre post for a
period exceeding three months, i.e., the period may be six months or more than six
months, but it should exceed three months. The period exceeding 6 months has,
therefore, no relevance whatsoever to the report to be made under sub-rule 2 of rule 9
of the Cadre Rules. The report under the said sub-rule may not be made only once in
all cases but it may be made subsequently every time, if it is proposed by the State
Government to further extend the initial period of the appointment exceeding three
months.
(b) Sub-rule (3) of the I.A.S./I.P.S. (Cadre) Rules, 1954, is self-contained and
independent of the provisions contained in sub-rules (1), (2) and (4) of the said rule.
Sub-rule (3) of rule 9 of the Cadre Rules empowers the Central Government to give
directions to the State Government at any time to terminate the temporary
appointment of a non-cadre officer to a cadre post, even without any report from the
State Government whether the period is less than three months or more than six
months. The words " or otherwise " occurring in sub-rule (3) of rule 9 of the Cadre Rules
are of great significance in this context and leave no scope for doubt.
(c) Sub rule (4) of rule 9 of the Cadre Rules does not place any restriction on
the aforesaid powers of the Central Government under sub-rule (3) of rule 9 . The
matter is to be referred to the Union Public Service Commission when the Central
Government comes to the conclusion that no suitable cadre officer is available for filling
the cadre post in question and does not want to terminate the appointment of the
non-cadre officer under sub-rule (3) of the said Rules Suitable directions are then
issued by the Central Government to the State Government Concerned in the light of
the advice given by the Union Public Service Commission. Such directions may
contemplate termination of appointment of the non-cadre officer on availability of a
suitable cadre officer or after a specified period or may stipulate other conditions.
Again the arrangement contemplated by the directions may be terminated by the
Central Government at any time under the powers vested in it by sub-rule (3) of rule 9
of the Cadre Rules.
(d) According to rule 8 read with rule 9, of the IAS/IPS (Cadre) Rules,1954, a
40
non-cadre officer has to be replaced by a suitable cadre officer as soon as one
becomes available. The appointment of non-cadre officer (Select List Officer etc.) to
hold the cadre post as a stop gap arrangement pending availability of a suitable
cadre officer does not give him any right to continue to hold the cadre post even after
a suitable cadre officer becomes available.
(e) The inclusion of the name of a State Civil Service officer in the Select List
does not confer any right on him, nor does he become a promoted officer merely by
virtue of such inclusion. Appointment of non-cadre officers (Select List Officer) to cadre
posts under rule 9 of the Cadre Rules is a purely temporary arrangement which may
be terminated at any time when the Central Government or the State Government or
the State Government concerned finds that suitable cadre officers have become
available. The Select List officers cannot be equated with the direct recruits who are
members of the service and are entitled to hold senior posts.
2.2. The State Government have been advised to keep the above instructions in
view while sending reports/proposals under rule 9 of the cadre Rules to the
Government of India.
[G.I., MHA letter No. 1/1/67-AIS(III), dated 11.1.1967.]
Government of India's Decision under Rule 10:
1.1. Instances have come to the notice of the Government of India in which State
Government kept in abeyance I.A.S. cadre posts under their control, under this rule
and simultaneously created, in lieu, ex-cadre posts involving identical duties and
responsibilities but carrying remuneration different from (generally above) that laid
down for the corresponding cadre posts.
1.2. The Government of India are of the view that, as a general rule, action of
this nature not only has the effect of altering the structure of the State I.A.S. cadre
concerned, but also tends to defeat more than one object embodied in the All India
Services Rules. The rules do not necessarily require the appointment of a cadre
officer to an ex-cadre post of this type. The appointment of a non-cadre officer to
what should really be a cadre post would be open to obvious objection; but so also
would the appointment of a cadre officer to an ex-cadre post which, by the very nature
of duties and responsibilities involved, should actually be a cadre post. The holding
in abeyance of certain cadre posts, and their substitution by ex-cadre posts carrying
different scales of rates or pay as well as status would thus result in an artificial
exclusion of certain posts from the cadre. Such appointments generally mean a
departure from the Pay Rules, and result in a distortion of the cadre structure. In
certain circumstances, there may well be reason to consider, the upgrading of a
cadre post from the senior time-scale to super time-scale on account of enhanced,
responsibilities. The proper course to adopt, in such cases, would, however, be for the
State Government to justify the upgrading of the post in question and make appropriate
proposals to the Central Government for a revision of the State Cadre Schedule. In
considering such proposals, the need for maintaining a broad measure of all-India
uniformity would, no doubt, have to be borne in mind.
1.3. Under this rule, the State Governments are required to make a report to the
41
Central Government in all cases in which the State Government propose to keep a
cadre post vacant for a period exceeding six months. The rule also lays down the
various particulars which are required to be furnished to the Central Government in
such reports. The purpose of the rule is to ensure that there is adequate
justification for the extension of such extraordinary arrangement beyond a period of
six months and its spirit is generally to discourage their indefinite continuance. The
rule, as at present worded, leaves it to the State Government to hold cadre posts in
abeyance when required. The corresponding arrangements in the case of the
ex-Secretary of State's Services was different. The then Provincial Governments were
advised by the late Home Department that, although it was correct that Provincial
Governments had power to create posts and to fix the pay thereof, it was never intended
that the provisions of the Reserve Posts (I.C.C.S.) Rules should be used in conjunction
with those powers to alter the construction of the cadre of a Service sanctioned by the
Secretary of State. They were also advised that the holding in abeyance of a `reserved
post' and the substitution for it of a superior `unreserved post' would render nugatory
the relevant provisions of the Act of 1935 relating to All-India Services, created by the
Secretary of State. It was therefore, enjoined on the Provincial Governments that
Secretary of State's sanction would be necessary to the holding in abeyance of a
reserved post and creation in its place of a temporary post different in status.
1.4. The general considerations relating to the organisation and working of All
India Services broadly continue to be the same. A suggestion has, therefore, been
made that a provision be added in this rule to the effect that cadre posts shall not be kept
vacant or held in abeyance for periods exceeding six months without the approval of
the Central Government. Such an amendment would not only be justified on the
basis of past precedent, but on the requirements of the present situation as well, and
above all, on account of the need for maintaining the all-India character of the I.A.S. In
fact, it has always been the intention that the holding of cadre posts in abeyance should
be resorted to only in exceptional circumstances, and although this rule does not
specifically provide for the Central Government's approval to the continued holding
in abeyance of a cadre post for period exceeding six months, the spirit of the rule, no
doubt, is to discourage the practice and to ensure that in every case in which it is
resorted to, the action is fully justified on the basis of various important consideration of
which some find mention in these rules itself.
1.5. The Government of India is of the view that it would be quite inappropriate to
hold a cadre post in abeyance and simultaneously to create in lieu an ex-cadre post
involving identical duties and responsibilities, but with a different status and pay
attached to it. However, they do not wish to suggest the addition of a provision of this
rule on the lines indicated above , and trust that the State Governments would agree
to act according to the views expressed in the preceding paragraphs and to the spirit of
this rule, thereby obviating the need for any formal amplification of the rule in the
manner proposed.
1.6. It is also observed that instances of cadre officers holding ex-cadre posts,
and of non-cadre officers holding cadre posts generally tend to be large in number.
The Government of India are of the view that this is not a satisfactory position and
the State Governments might as a matter of general policy employ cadre officers as far
as possible on cadre posts.

Government of India's Decisions under Rule 11:
1.1. The term `equivalent post' includes a post in a body, incorporated or not,
which is wholly or substantially owned by the Government i.e., a post of foreign
service, in view of the provisions contained in sub-rules (2) and (3) of rule 9 of the Pay
Rules. Thus the provisions of rule 11 of the Cadre Rules are attracted where a cadre
officer holds a cadre post and a post on foreign service simultaneously.
1.2. Combination of Government service with foreign service in one officer, is,
however, not desirable and should be resorted to only in exceptional circumstances.

1. Introduction
1.1 The Government uses e-mail as a major mode of communication.
Communications include Government of India (GoI) data that travel
as part of mail transactions between users [1] located both within the
country and outside.
1.2 This policy of Government of India lays down the guidelines with
respect to use of e-mail services. The Implementing Agency (IA) [2]
for the GoI e-mail service shall be National Informatics Centre
(NIC), under the Department of Electronics and Information
Technology (DeitY), Ministry of Communications and Information
Technology. The organisations exempted under Clause 14 will
themselves become the Implementing Agency (IA) for the purpose
of this policy.
2. Scope
2.1 Only the e-mail services provided by NIC, the Implementing Agency
of the Government of India shall be used for official
communications by all organizations except those exempted under
clause no 14 of this policy. The e-mail services provided by other
service providers shall not be used for any official communication.
2.2 This policy is applicable to all employees of GoI and employees of
those State/UT Governments that use the e-mail services of GoI
and also those State/UT Governments that choose to adopt this
policy in future. The directives contained in this policy must be
followed by all of them with no exceptions. All users of e-mail
services can find further information in the supporting policies
available on http://www.deity.gov.in/content/policiesguidelines
under the caption “E-mail Policy”.
2.3 E-mail can be used as part of the electronic file processing in
Government of India. Further information in this regard is available

Edition.pdf.
3. Objective
3.1 The objective of this policy is to ensure secure access and usage of
Government of India e-mail services by its users. Users have the
responsibility to use this resource in an efficient, effective, lawful,
and ethical manner. Use of the Government of India e-mail service
amounts to the user's agreement to be governed by this policy.
3.2 All services under e-mail are offered free of cost to all officials
under Ministries / Departments / Statutory Bodies / Autonomous
bodies (henceforth referred to as “Organization [3]” in the policy) of
both Central and State/UT Governments. More information is
available under “NIC e-mail Services and Usage Policy” at
http://www.deity.gov.in/content/policiesguidelines/ under the caption
“E-mail Policy”.
3.3 Any other policies, guidelines or instructions on e-mail previously
issued shall be superseded by this policy.
4. Roles specified for implementation of the Policy
The following roles are specified in each organization using the GoI e-mail
service. The official identified for the task shall be responsible for the
management of the entire user base configured under that respective
domain.

5. Basic requirements of GoI e-mail Service
5.1 Security
F. No. 2(22)/2013-EG-II
Ministry of Communication & Information Technology
Department of Electronics & Information Technology
Page 5 of 16
a) Considering the security concerns with regard to a sensitive
deployment like e-mail, apart from the service provided by the
IA, there would not be any other e-mail service under GoI.
b) All organizations, except those exempted under clause 14 of
this policy, should migrate their e-mail services to the
centralized deployment of the IA for security reasons and
uniform policy enforcement. For the purpose of continuity, the
e-mail address of the organization migrating their service to
the IA deployment shall be retained as part of the migration
process. Wherever it is technically feasible, data migration
shall also be done.
c) Secure access to the GoI email service
i) It is recommended for users working in sensitive offices
to use VPN[7]/OTP[8] for secure authentication as deemed
appropriate by the competent authority.
ii) It is recommended that GoI officials on long
deputation/stationed abroad and handling sensitive
information should use (VPN)/ (OTP) for accessing GoI e-
mail services as deemed appropriate by the competent
authority.
iii) It is recommended that Embassies and missions abroad
should use Static IP addresses for accessing the services
of the IA as deemed appropriate by the competent
authority.
iv) More information is available under “Guidelines for E-mail
Management and Effective E-mail Usage” at
http://www.deity.gov.in/content/policiesguidelines under
the caption “E-mail Policy”.
d) From the perspective of security, the following shall be
adhered to by all users of GoI e-mail service:
i) Relevant Policies framed by Ministry of Home Affairs,
relating to classification, handling and security of
information shall be followed.
F. No. 2(22)/2013-EG-II
Ministry of Communication & Information Technology
Department of Electronics & Information Technology
Page 6 of 16
ii) Use of Digital Signature Certificate (DSC) [6] and
encryption shall , be mandatory for sending e-mails
deemed as classified and sensitive, in accordance with
the relevant policies of Ministry of Home Affairs. Updation
of current mobile numbers under the personal profile of
users is mandatory for security reasons. The number
would be used only for alerts and information regarding
security sent by the IA. Updation of personal e-mail id
(preferably from a service provider within India), in
addition to the mobile number, shall also be mandatory in
order to reach the user through an alternate means for
sending alerts.
iii) Users shall not download e-mails from their official e-mail
account, configured on the GoI mail server, by configuring
POP [9] or IMAP [10] on any other e-mail service provider.
This implies that users should not provide their GoI e-mail
account details (id and password) to their accounts on
private e-mail service providers.
iv) Any e-mail addressed to a user, whose account has been
deactivated /deleted, shall not be redirected to another e-
mail address. Such e-mails may contain contents that
belong to the Government and hence no e-mails shall be
redirected.
v) The concerned nodal officer of the organization shall
ensure that the latest operating system, anti-virus and
application patches are available on all the devices, in
coordination with the User.
vi) In case a compromise of an e-mail id is detected by the
IA, an SMS alert shall be sent to the user on the
registered mobile number. In case an “attempt” to
compromise the password of an account is detected, an
e-mail alert shall be sent. Both the e-mail and the SMS
shall contain details of the action to be taken by the user.
In case a user does not take the required action even
F. No. 2(22)/2013-EG-II
Ministry of Communication & Information Technology
Department of Electronics & Information Technology
Page 7 of 16
after five such alerts (indicating a compromise), the IA
reserves the right to reset the password of that particular
e-mail id under intimation to the nodal officer of that
respective organization.
vii) In case of a situation when a compromise of a user id
impacts a large user base or the data security of the
deployment, the IA shall reset the password of that user
id. This action shall be taken on an immediate basis, and
the information shall be provided to the user and the nodal
officer subsequently. SMS shall be one of the prime
channels to contact a user; hence all users should ensure
that their mobile numbers are updated.
viii) Forwarding of e-mail from the e-mail id provided by GoI to
the Government official’s personal id outside the GoI e-
mail service is not allowed due to security reasons.
Official e-mail id provided by the IA can be used to
communicate with any other user, whether private or
public. However, the user must exercise due discretion on
the contents that are being sent as part of the e-mail.
ix) Auto-save of password in the Government e-mail service
shall not be permitted due to security reasons.
x) More details regarding security measures are available in
“NIC Security Policy” at
http://www.deity.gov.in/content/policiesguidelines under
the caption “E-mail Policy”.
xi) The guidelines for effective e-mail usage have been
described in “Guidelines for E-mail Account Management
and Effective E-mail Usage” available at
http://www.deity.gov.in/content/policiesguidelines under
the caption “Email Policy”.
5.2 E-mail Account Management
F. No. 2(22)/2013-EG-II
Ministry of Communication & Information Technology
Department of Electronics & Information Technology
Page 8 of 16
a) Based on the request of the respective organizations, IA will
create two ids, one based on the designation and the other
based on the name. Designation based id’s are recommended
for officers dealing with the public. Use of alphanumeric
characters as part of the e-mail id is recommended for
sensitive users as deemed appropriate by the competent
authority.
b) Government officers who resign or superannuate after
rendering at least 20 years of service shall be allowed to
retain the name based e-mail address i.e. userid@gov.in for
one year post resignation or superannuation. Subsequently, a
new e-mail address with the same user id but with a different
domain address (for instance, userid@pension.gov.in), would
be provided by the IA for their entire life.
More details pertaining to e-mail account management are
provided in “Guidelines for E-mail Account Management and
Effective E-mail Usage”” available at
http://www.deity.gov.in/content/policiesguidelines under the caption
“Email Policy”. The document covers creation of E-mail addresses,
process of account creation, process of handover of designation-
based ids, status of account after resignation and superannuation,
data retention & backup and deactivation of accounts.
5.3 Delegated Admin Console
Organizations can avail the “Delegated Admin Console" service
from IA. Using the console the authorized person of an organization
can create/delete/change the password of user ids under that
respective domain as and when required without routing the
request through IA. Organizations that do not opt for the admin
console need to forward their requests with complete details to the
IA’s support cell (support@gov.in).

GLOSSARY
S.No TERM DEFINITION
1 Users Refers to Government/State/UT employees who are
accessing the Government e-mail services.
2 Implementing
agency (IA)
For the purpose of this policy, the implementing agency is
“National Informatics Centre” under the Department of
Electronics and Information Technology, Ministry of
Communications and Information Technology, Government
of India
3 Organization For the purpose of this policy, organisation refers to all
ministries/departments/offices/statutory bodies/autonomous
bodies, both at the Central and State level. Government
organizations offering commercial services are not included.
4 Competent Authority Officer responsible for taking and approving all decisions
relating to this policy in his Organization
5. Nodal Officer Officer responsible for all matters relating to this policy who
will coordinate on behalf of the Organization
6 DSC A digital signature is a mathematical scheme for
demonstrating the authenticity of a digital message or
document. A valid digital signature gives the recipient
reason to believe that the e-mail was created by a known
sender, such that the sender cannot deny having sent the
e-mail (authentication and non-repudiation) and that the e-
mail was not altered in transit (integrity).
7 VPN A virtual private network extends a private network across
a public network, such as the Internet. It enables a
computer to send and receive data across shared or public
networks as if it were directly connected to the private
network, while benefitting from the functionality, security
and management policies of the private network
8 OTP A one-time password (OTP) is a password that is valid for
only one login session or transaction. OTPs avoid a number
of shortcomings that are associated with traditional (static)
passwords
9 POP POP is short for Post Office Protocol, a protocol used to
retrieve e-mail from a mail server.
10 IMAP IMAP is short for “The Internet Message Access
Protocol”, a protocol used to retrieve e-mail from a remote
mail server. Unlike POP, in IMAP, Messages are displayed
on your local computer but are kept and stored on the mail
server. IMAP allows you to sync your folders with the e-mail
server which is not possible using POP.

11 Deactivation Deactivation of an account means that the account can no
longer be accessed. All e-mails sent to a deactivated
account shall bounce to the sender
12 Phishing Phishing is a fraudulent attempt, usually made through e-
mail, to steal a user’s personal information. Phishing e-
mails almost always tell a user to click a link that takes the
user to a site from where the personal information is
requested. Legitimate organisations would never request
this information via e-mail. Users should never click on a
link. A user should always type a URL in the browser even if
the link appears genuine.
13 Intranet An intranet is a private network that is contained within an
organization. For the purpose of this policy, computers
connected to an intranet are not allowed to connect to
internet.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS
The Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) of the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO)
released in May 2019 for the period July 2017 to July 2018 showed the unemployment rate in
the country was at 5.3 per cent in rural India and 7.8 per cent in urban India, resulting in
overall unemployment rate of 6.1 per cent. According to Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy
(CMIE) the unemployment rate in India rose to 7.2 per cent in February 2019, the highest
since September 2016, and up from 5.9 per cent in February 2018.
As a result the exploitation of workers has been increasing rapidly in the country.
Poverty has forced people to migrate in search of work and workers with no other skills, turn
to domestic work. This has also led to the trafficking and other forms of exploitation of
millions of women and children of both the sexes. To meet growing demand of domestic help,
there has been a spurt of thousands of placement agencies providing domestic workers in
metro-towns of many States which remain outside the purview of any legislative control. The
issue of exploitation of women and children domestic workers is frequent and regularly
reported. With no rights and rules to fall back on, the domestic helps, mostly migrants from
eastern States, have become contemporary slaves. It is also a known fact that many women
and children are trafficked and exploited by the placement agencies, which operate openly
without any form of restrictions and regulations, also escaping the tax net, thus necessitating
the need for regulation and control. The domestic workers fall outside the Labour legislations
thus domestic workers are unable to access their rights. That non-recognition of domestic
work as legitimate work combined with hidden nature of the worksite results in exploitative
living and working conditions and sometimes forced labour and trafficking. Reports of abuse
are many with workers facing among other things , extremely long working hours , absence of
rest and leave periods, deprivation of food, delayed or non-payment of wages and physical
and sexual abuse, recruitment related fees, deceptive recruitment practices and discriminative
policies further jeopardizes domestic workers right to just and favorable working conditions.
Formal employment has become very competitive which forces young people to apply
for various internships so as to gain experience. Unpaid internships have become a big,
exploitative, self-perpetuating circle in India, where countless graduates enter into these
internships every year to gather that all important marker for employment — experience.
Since most companies insist on a certain amount of work experience before they hire for a
particular role, the only avenue for many fresh graduates is to allow their labour to be
exploited via internship work over a specific period of time. The world of internships and
interns in India is by no means tiny. It is mildly disturbing, then, that there are absolutely no
laws that cover interns in India. Thus, there is a need for a new law which regulates the huge
market of internships in the country. The vast reach of internet and increasing use of online
and electronic services to seek job also creates a need to regulate such employment agencies
which operate online.
To add more in exploitation of job seekers, fraudulent and fake employment agencies
have mushroomed in India and de-frauding job seekers to the extent of publishing fake
employment notices in the name of Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs). Recent example is of
'South Central Coalfield Ltd. a fake company that claimed to be a subsidiary of Coal India Ltd.
This fake company not only published employment notice but also demanded security
deposits from job seekers. Later, Coal India published a notice to beware job seekers from
this fraudulent company.
Thus it is imperative that a law be enacted to provide for safety and security of domestic
workers, interns and other employees and regulate the placement/employment agencies
which cater to providing employment to any class/category of persons. The law needs to be
broader and go beyond the scope of domestic workers as placement agencies not only cater
to domestic but also other employment requirements.
Hence this Bill.

FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM
Clause 7 of the Bill provides for appointment of Licensing Officer. Clause 15 provides
for nomination of an Appellate Officer. Clause 17 provides for appointment of Inspector. The
Bill, therefore, if enacted, would involve expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India. It
is estimated that a recurring expenditure of about rupees five hundred crore per annum will
be involved from the Consolidated Fund of India.
A non-recurring expenditure of about rupees three hundred crore is also likely to be
involved.
10
MEMORANDUM REGARDING DELEGATED LEGISLATION
Clause 23 of the Bill empowers the appropriate Government to make rules for carrying
out the purposes of the Bill. As the rules will relate to matters of detail only, the delegation of
legislative powers is of a normal character.

THE CONSTITUTION (FIRST AMENDMENT) ACT, 1951
Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Constitution (First Amendment) Bill, 1951
which was enacted as the Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951
STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS
During the last fifteen months of the working of the Constitution, certain difficulties have been
brought to light by judicial decisions and pronouncements specially in regard to the chapter on
fundamental rights. The citizen's right to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by
article 19(1)(a) has been held by some courts to be so comprehensive as not to render a person
culpable even if he advocates murder and other crimes of violence. In other countries with
written constitutions, freedom of speech and of the press is not regarded as debarring the State
from punishing or preventing abuse of this freedom. The citizen's right to practise any
profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or business conferred by article 19(1)(g) is
subject to reasonable restrictions which the laws of the State may impose "in the interests of
general public". While the words cited are comprehensive enough to cover any scheme of
nationalisation which the State may undertake, it is desirable to place the matter beyond doubt
by a clarificatory addition to article 19(6). Another article in regard to which unanticipated
difficulties have arisen is article 31. The validity of agrarian reform measures passed by the
State Legislatures in the last three years has, in spite of the provisions of clauses (4) and (6) of
article 31, formed the subject-matter of dilatory litigation, as a result of which the
implementation of these
important measures, affecting large numbers of people, has been held up.
The main objects of this Bill are, accordingly to amend article 19 for the purposes indicated
above and to insert provisions fully securing the constitutional validity of zamindari abolition
laws in general and certain specified State Acts in particular. the opportunity has been taken to
propose a few minor amendments to other articles in order to remove difficulties that may arise.
It is laid down in article 46 as a directive principle of State policy that the State should promote
with special care the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of the people
and protect them from social injustice. In order that any special provision that the State may
make for the educational, economic or social advancement of any backward class of citizens
may not be challenged on the ground
of being discriminatory, it is proposed that article 15(3) should be suitably amplified. Certain
amendments in respect of articles dealing with the convening and proroguing of the sessions
of Parliament have been found necessary and are also incorporated in this Bill. So also a few
minor amendments in respect of articles 341, 342, 372 and 376.

THE CONSTITUTION (SECOND AMENDMENT) ACT,
1952
THE CONSTITUTION (SECOND AMENDMENT) ACT, 1952
Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to THE CONSTITUTION (Second Amendment)
Bill, 1952 which was enacted as the the Constitution (Second Amendment) Act, 1952
STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS
Article 81(1)(a) prescribes an absolute limit of 500 elected members in the House of the People.
Article 81(1)(b) provides that the States shall be divided, grouped or formed into territorial
constituencies and the number of members to be allotted to each such constituency shall be so
determined as to ensure that there shall be not less than one member for every 750,000 of the
population and not more than one member for every 500,000 of the population.
The present delimitation of Parliamentary and Assembly constituencies is based on the
estimates of population which have been given legal validity by an order of the President under
article 387 of the Constitution. Article 81(3) of the Constitution, however, requires that upon
the completion of each census, the representation of the several territorial constituencies in the
House of the People and the Legislative Assemblies of each State shall be re-adjusted by such
authority, in such manner and with effect from such date as Parliament may by law determine.
A Bill providing for the matters referred to in that article is being introduced in Parliament.
Provision has been made in that Bill for the setting up of a Delimitation Commission for the
purpose of effecting re-adjustment of the representation in the House of the People and in the
State Legislative Assemblies on the basis of the population as ascertained at the census of 1951.
There is a considerable difference between the population of the several States as estimated in
the President's order and in the population as ascertained at the census of 1951. At present,
seats have been allotted in the House of the People to Part A and Part B States on the basis of
one member for every 7.2 lakhs of the estimated population giving a total of 470 members to
these States. The census figures are higher in all cases, and in view of the overall limit of 500
members prescribed in article 81(1) (a), it is not possible to increase appreciably the total
number of seats allotted to these States. It is accordingly necessary to reduce the representation
from one member for every 7.2 lakhs of population to one member for every 7.5 lakhs of
population as per 1951 census. As pointed out above, this figure 7.5 lakhs is the maximum
permissible under article 81(1)(b) as it now stands; but even so, if the average population of a
Parliamentary constituency in any State is to be 750,000 it is obvious that the population of a
certain number of constituencies will exceed that figure. It is necessary, therefore, that article
81(1)(b) should be amended relaxing the limits prescribed in that article so as to avoid a
constitutional irregularity in delimiting the constitutencies for the purpose of re-adjustment of
representation in the House of the People as required under article 81(3) of the Constitution.
This Bill accordingly seeks to amend article 81(1)(b) of the Constitution so as to replace the
figures mentioned in that article by the figures 850,000 and 650,000 respectively.

1955
THE CONSTITUTION (FOURTH AMENDMENT) ACT, 1955
Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to THE CONSTITUTION (Fourth Amendment)
Bill, 1954 which was enacted as the Constitution (Fourth Amendment) Act, 1954
STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS
This Bill seeks to amend articles 31, 31A and 305 of, and the Ninth Schedule to, the
Constitution.
2. Recent decisions of the Supreme Court have given a very wide meaning to clauses (1) and
(2) of article 31. Despite the difference in the wording of the two clauses, they are regarded as
dealing with the same subject. The deprivation of property referred to in clause (1) is to be
construed in the widest sense as including any curtailment of a right to property. Even where
it is caused by a purely regulatory provision of law and is not accompanied by an acquisition
or taking possession of that or any other property right by the State, the law, in order to be valid
according to these decisions, has to provide for compensation under clause (2) of the article. It
is considered necessary, therefore, to re-state more precisely the State's power of compulsory
acquisition and requisitioning of private property and distinguish it from cases where the
operation of regulatory or prohibitory laws of the State results in "deprivation of property".
This is sought to be done in clause 2 of the Bill.
3. It will be recalled that the zamindari abolition laws which came first in our programme of
social welfare legislation were attacked by the interests affected mainly with reference to
articles 14, 19 and 31, and that in order to put an end to the dilatory and wasteful litigation and
place these laws above challenge in the courts, articles 31A and 31B and the Ninth Schedule
were enacted by the Constitution (First Amendment) Act. Subsequent judicial decisions
interpreting articles 14, 19 and 31 have raised serious difficulties in the way of the Union and
the States putting through other and equally important social welfare legislation on the desired
lines, e.g., the following:-
(i) While the abolition of zamindaris and the numerous intermediaries between the State and
the tiller of the soil has been achieved for the most part, our next objectives in land reform are
the fixing of limits to the extent of agricultural land that may be owned or occupied by any
person, the disposal of any land held in excess of the prescribed maximum and the further
modification of the rights of land owners and tenants in agricultural holdings.
(ii) The proper planning of urban and rural areas require the beneficial utilisation of vacant and
waste lands and the clearance of slum areas.
(iii) In the interest of national economy the State should have full control over the mineral and
oil resources of the country, including in particular, the power to cancel or modify the terms
and conditions of prospecting licenses, mining leases and similar agreements. This is also
necessary in relation to public utility undertakings which supply power, light or water to the
public under licenses granted by the State.
(iv) It is often necessary to take over under State management for a temporary period a
commercial or industrial undertaking or other property in the public interest or in order to
secure the better management of the undertaking or property. Laws providing for such
temporary transference to State management should be permissible under the Constitution.
(v) The reforms in company law now under contemplation, like the progressive elimination of
the managing agency system, provision for the compulsory amalgamation of two or more
companies in the national interest, the transfer of an undertaking from one company to another,
etc., require to be placed above challenge.
It is accordingly proposed in clause 3 of the Bill to extend the scope of article 31A so as to
cover these categories of essential welfare legislation.
4. As a corollary to the proposed amendment of article 31A, it is propsed in clause 5 of the Bill
to include in the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution two more State Acts and four Central Acts
which fall within the scope of sub-clauses (d) and (f) of clause (1) of the revised article 31A.
The effect will be their complete, retrospective validation under the provisions of article 31B.
5. A recent judgment of the Supreme Court in Saghir Ahmed v. the State of U.P. has raised the
question whether an Act providing for a State monopoly in a particular trade or business
conflicts with the freedom of trade and commerce guaranteed by article 301, but left the
question undecided. Clause (6) of article 19 was amended by the Constitution (First
Amendment) Act in order to take such State monopolies out of the purview of sub-clause (g)
of clause (1) of that article, but no corresponding provision was made in Part XIII of the
Constitution with reference to the opening words of article 301. It apears from the judgment of
the Supreme Court that notwithstanding the clear authority of Parliament or of a State
Legislature to introduce State monopoly in a particular sphere of trade or commerce, the law
might have to be justified before the courts as being "in the public interest" under article 301
or as amounting to a "reasonable restriction" under article 304(b). It is considered that any such
question ought to be left to the final decision of the Legislatue. Clause 4 of the Bill accordingly
proposes an amendment of article 305 to make this clear.

the Constitution two more State Acts and four Central Acts which fall
within the scope of sub-clauses (d) and (f) of clause (1) of the
revised article 31A. The effect will be their complete, retrospective
validation under the provisions of article 31B.
5. A recent judgment of the Supreme Court in Saghir Ahmed v. the
State of U.P. has raised the question whether an Act providing for a
State monopoly in a particular trade or business conflicts with the
freedom of trade and commerce guaranteed by article 301, but left the
question undecided. Clause (6) of article 19 was amended by the
Constitution (First Amendment) Act in order to take such State
monopolies out of the purview of sub-clause (g) of clause (1) of that
article, but no corresponding provision was made in Part XIII of the
Constitution with reference to the opening words of article 301. It
apears from the judgment of the Supreme Court that notwithstanding the
clear authority of Parliament or of a State Legislature to introduce
State monopoly in a particular sphere of trade or commerce, the law
might have to be justified before the courts as being "in the public
interest" under article 301 or as amounting to a "reasonable
restriction" under article 304(b). It is considered that any such
question ought to be left to the final decision of the Legislatue.
Clause 4 of the Bill accordingly proposes an amendment of article 305
to make this clear.

LANDMARK JUDGMENTS OF THE
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Justice Ved Prakash
Chairman
Law Commission of Madhya Pradesh
1
The Organic Element of Law
“The inevitable truth is that law is not static and
immutable but ever increasingly dynamic and
grows with the ongoing passage of time.”
• S. Ratnavel Pandian, J.
in Supreme Court Advocates on Record
Association Vs. Union of India (1993) 4 SCC 441
2
The Supreme Court of India
• The Supreme Court of India is the highest
Constitutional court of the Country which can
be accessed directly by a citizen under Article
32 of the Constitution for redress of
fundamental rights. Commencing with eight
judges, the sanctioned strength of the Court
presently stands at 34.
3
Great judgment vs. Landmark judgment
• A great judgment is one that restores the constitutional
values of a polity from the waywardness into which it
may have fallen, while a landmark judgment is one
which opens up new directions in our constitutional
thinking and, in the process, adds new dimensions to
what are regarded as established constitutional
principles. If “great” restores the centrality of
constitutional values, “landmark” revitalises them.”-
Peter Ronald deSouza, Professor at the Centre for
the Study of Developing Societies, Delhi

Landmark Judgments
• “...... When histories of nations are written
and critiqued, there are judicial decisions at
the forefront of liberty. Yet others have to be
consigned to the archives, reflective of what
was, but should never have been.”
D.Y Chandrachud J.
In Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (retd.) Vs. Union
of India and ors. , (2017) 10 SCC 1
5
1. Personal Liberty: Procedure Established by
Law:
• A.K.Gopalan VS. State of Madras ,[1950] SCR 88
• The petitioner, detained under the Preventive Detention
Act challenged the legality of detention under Art. 32 of
the Constitution on the ground that the said Act
contravened Arts. 13, 19, 21 and 22 of the Constitution
and was, therefore, ultra vires.
• The S.C. held- that Article 22 was a self-contained Code
and if personal liberty is taken away by the State in
accordance with the procedure established by law i.e. if
the detention was as per the procedure established by
law, then it cannot be said that the law was violative of
provisions contained in Articles 14 ,19 and 21 of the
Constitution.
6
Personal Liberty: Procedure Established by Law:
Fair, Just and Reasonable
Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India (AIR 1978 SC 597) (1978).
• The view expressed in A. K. Gopalan’s case was revisited in
this case after about 28 years.
• The main issues were whether the right to go abroad is a
part of the right to personal liberty under Article 21 and
whether the Passport Act prescribes a ‘procedure’ as
required by Article 21 of the Constitution.
• The SC held that the right to go abroad is a part of the right
to personal liberty under Article 21.
• The SC also ruled that the mere existence of an enabling
law was not enough to restrain personal liberty. “The
procedure prescribed by law has to be fair, just and
reasonable, not fanciful, oppressive or arbitrary. ”
7
LIFE AND LIBERTY: ADM Jabalpur v. Shivakant
Shukla, (1976) 2 SCC 521
• A Constitution Bench by a majority of 4:1, ruled that while a
proclamation of emergency is in operation, the right to move
High Courts under Article 226 for Habeas Corpus challenging
illegal detention by State will stand suspended. The apex
Court said “ . .....If extraordinary powers are given, they are
given because the Emergency is extraordinary, and are limited
to the period of the Emergency.”
• The judgment is more recognised for the dissenting opinion
of Justice HR Khanna in which he said - "detention without
trial is an anathema to all those who love personal liberty... A
dissent is an appeal to the brooding spirit of the law, to the
intelligence of a future day, when a later decision may
possibly correct the error into which the dissenting Judge
believes the court to have been betrayed".
8
LIFE AND LIBERTY: ADM Jabalpur v. Shivakant
Shukla- OVERRULED
• In Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (retd.) Vs. Union of India and
ors. , (2017) 10 SCC 1 para 121 (Nine Judges), the apex
Court overruling the majority view expressed in ADM
Jabalpur v. Shivkant Shukla (1976) 2 SCC 521, held-
• “The view taken by Justice Khanna must be accepted,
and accepted in reverence for the strength of its thoughts
and the courage of its convictions...”
• Sanjay Kishan Kaul, J. in his concurring judgment said:
“...the ADM Jabalpur case which was an aberration in the
constitutional jurisprudence of our country and the
desirability of burying the majority opinion ten fathom
deep, with no chance of resurrection.”

2.Amendability of Fundamental Rights
Shankari Prasad v. Union of India , [1952] SCR 89 (1951): This
case dealt with the amendability of Fundamental Rights
(the First Amendment’s validity was challenged).
• The SC Court held that the power conferred on
Parliament by Art. 368 to amend is a very wide power and
includes the power to take away the fundamental rights
guaranteed by Part III. , and
• that in the context of Art. 13 (2), "law" must be taken to
mean rules or regulations made in exercise of ordinary
legislative power and not amendments to the
constitution made in the exercise of constituent power
with the result that Art. 13(2) does not affect
amendments made under Art. 368.
• This view was reiterated in Sajjan Singh vs State Of
Rajasthan, AIR 1965 SC 845 10
Amendability of Fundamental Rights
The issues regarding power of the Parliament to amend Part
III of the Constitution was re-examined in I. C. Golak Nath
v. State of Punjab, AIR 1967 SC 1643
• The questions in this case were whether amendment is a
law within the meaning of Art.13(2) of the Constitution of
India, and
• whether Fundamental Rights can be amended by the
Parliament?
• Overruling Sajjan Singh by a majority of six to five the
Supreme Court held that amendment under Article 368 is
“law” within the meaning of Article 13(2);
• It further ruled that Legislature does not enjoy the power
to amend Part III of the Constitution to take away or abridge
fundamental rights .
11
3. The Doctrine of Basic Structure
His Holiness Kesavananda Bharati Sripadagalavaru v. State of
Kerala, AIR 1973 SC 1461 (decided by a Bench of 13 Judges)
• The most celebrated case in the history of Indian Constitutional
law in which the apex Court dealt with the issue - whether the
Parliament can amend any part of the Constitution and what was
the limit to that power?
• The Bench by a majority of 7-6 Overruled the proposition of law
propounded in I. C. Golak Nath v. State of Punjab, AIR 1967 SC
1643 and held that Constitutional amendment is not “law” within
the meaning of Article 13 and that although no part of the
Constitution, including Part III comprising of fundamental rights,
was beyond the Parliament’s amending power, the “basic
structure of the Constitution” could not be abrogated even by a
constitutional amendment.”
• As regards the basic structure, the Court held that it would be
decided from case to case . 12
The Doctrine of Basic Structure-
Application
Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Raj Narain 1975 SC 2299
• The validity of 39th Constitution amendment
enacted in 1975 which (Article 39-A ) sought to
place the election of the President, the Vice
President, the Prime Minister and the Speaker of
the Lok Sabha beyond the scrutiny of the
constitutional courts was challenged in this case.
The S.C. resorting to the theory of basic
structure of the Constitution struck down Clause
(4) of Article 329-A on the grounds that it was
beyond the Parliament’s amending power as it
destroyed the basic structure of the Constitution.
13
The Doctrine of Basic Structure- Minerva Mills
case, (1980) AIR 1980 SC 1789
Validity of Constitution (42nd Amendment) Act, 1976
,which inter alia provided for exclusion of judicial review of
constitutional amendments and expressly conferred
unlimited amendment power to the Parliament, was
challenged on the ground that they are violative of the
‘basic structure’ of the Constitution.
• The Court by a majority of 4 to 1 struck down clauses (4)
and (5) of article 368 holding that they violated the basic
structure of the Constitution.
• The Court ruled that Parliament’s power to make
Constitutional amendments is limited which itself is a
basic feature of the Constitution. The judgement makes it
clear that the Constitution, and not the Parliament is
supreme.
14
The Doctrine of Basic Structure: IR Coelho’s Case (2007) 2
SCC 1 (Known as 9th Schedule Case) (Nine Judge Bench)
• Basic Structure : A land mark judgment on the
interpretation of the doctrine of basic structure of
the constitution.
• The supremacy of the Constitution mandates all
constitutional bodies to comply with the provisions
of the Constitution.
• Judicial Review : A mechanism for testing the
validity of legislative acts through an independent
organ, viz. the judiciary is part of basic structure.
• The Court held that any law inserted in the Ninth
Schedule on or after April 24, 1973 (date on which
Keshavananda was pronounced) can be subject to
judicial review and will be struck down if it violates
the basic structure doctrine. 15
4. Public Interest Litigation- The Beginning
Mumbai Kamgar Sabha, Bombay ,AIR 1976 SC 1455
This case is considered to be the foundation of public interest
litigation in India.
• In this case Justice V.R. Krishna Iyer speaking for the Court
held that- “Procedural prescriptions are handmaids, not
mistresses, of justice... . Our adjectival branch of
jurisprudence, by and large, deals not with sophisticated
litigants but the rural poor, the urban lay and the weaker
societal segments for whom law will be an added terror.
• Test litigations, representative actions, pro bono publico
and like broadened forms of legal proceedings are in
keeping with the current accent on justice to the common
man and a necessary disincentive to those who wish to
bypass the real issues on the merits by suspect reliance on
peripheral procedural, shortcomings. 16
Public Interest Litigation: Sunil Batra v. Delhi
Administration & Others, AIR 1978 SC 1675
A landmark decision on prison reforms , in this case the apex
Court held that a convict is entitled to the precious right
guaranteed by Art. 21 that he shall not be deprived of
his life or personal liberty except according to the
procedure established by law.
• The Court ruled that fundamental rights do not flee the
person as he enters the prison although they may suffer
shrinkage necessitated by incarceration. Our
Constitutional culture has now crystallised in favour of
prison justice and judicial jurisdiction.
• The intervention of social welfare organisations in litigative
processes pregnant with wider implications is a healthy
mediation between the people and the rule of law.
• The Court issued a number of direction for improving the
conditions of jail inmates. 17
Public Interest Litigation: Bandhua Mukti Morcha
v. Union of India [(1984) 3 SCC 161
In a matter concerning release of bonded labour raised by
way of PIL the Supreme Court issued direction for their
release.
• Explaining the philosophy underlying PIL the Court ruled
that where a person or class of persons to whom legal injury
is caused by reason of violation of a fundamental right is
unable to approach the court of judicial redress on account
of poverty or disability or socially or economically
disadvantaged position, any member of the public acting
bona fide can move the court for relief under Article 32 and
a fortiorari also under Article 226, so that the fundamental
rights may be meaningful not only for the rich but also for
the deprived people who by reason of lack of awareness,
assertiveness and resources are unable to seek judicial
redress. 18
5. Human Rights; Art.21- Right to Die With
Dignity
• In this case the victim of rape continued to be in persistent
vegetative state (PVS) for a period of 36 years. This case
triggered the debate on need to change euthanasia laws.
• In a writ petition under Article 32 it was prayed that the
hospital where she is laying for last 36 years be directed to stop
the life support system.
• The Supreme Court ruled that individuals had a right to die
with dignity.
• Issuing guidelines regarding passive euthanasia the court ruled
that a decision to discontinue life support can be taken either
by the parents or the spouse or other close relatives, or in the
absence of any of them, even by a person or a body of persons
acting as a next friend or in their absence by the doctors
attending the patient, subject to approval of the High Court. 19
Human Rights : Common Cause (A Regd. Society) vs. Union
Of India on 9 March, 2018 -Right to Die With Dignity
• The apex Court held that right to life and liberty as
envisaged under Article 21 of the Constitution
encompasses within its sphere individual dignity and
that the right to live with dignity also includes the
smoothening of the process of dying in case of a
terminally ill patient or a person in PVS with no hope
of recovery, and
• that a competent person who has come of age has
the right to refuse specific treatment or all treatment
or opt for an alternative treatment, even if such
decision entails a risk of death.
• Detailed directions issued by the apex Court in this
regard. 20
Human Rights: Recognition of Transgender Persons
as a Third Gender
National Legal Services Authority vs Union Of India & Ors. (2014)
Held:
• Gender identity is integral to the dignity of an individual and is
at the core of “personal autonomy” and “self-determination”
and Article 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution within their sweep
include transgender and are not as such limited to male or
female gender.
• Eunuchs, therefore, have to be considered as Third Gender,
over and above binary genders under our Constitution and the
laws.
• The apex Court directed the Centre and the State Governments
to take steps to treat them as socially and educationally
backward classes of citizens and extend all kinds of reservation
in cases of admission in educational institutions and for public
appointments. ( W.P.(civil) no.400 of 2012 dt.15.04.14) 21
Human Rights: Right to Privacy a
Fundamental Right under Article 21
Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (retd.) Vs. Union of India
and ors. , (2017) 10 SCC 1 (2017) (Right To
Privacy )
• In this case , popularly known as Aadhaar Case,
the SC held that privacy is a constitutionally
protected right which emerges primarily from the
guarantee of life and personal liberty in Article 21
of the Constitution.
• Further held that elements of privacy also arise in
varying contexts from the other facets of
freedom and dignity recognised and guaranteed
by the fundamental rights contained in Part III .
22
Human Rights: Decriminalising
Homosexuality
Navtej Singh Johar vs. Union Of India , (2018) 10 SCC 1(2018)
• A five-judge SC bench gave a historic, unanimous decision on
Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, decriminalising
homosexuality.
• The S.C ruled that sexual orientation is an intrinsic element of
liberty, dignity, privacy, individual autonomy and equality and that
intimacy between consenting adults of the same-sex is beyond the
legitimate interests of the state.
• Section 377 was the product of the Victorian era, with its
attendant moral values. Victorian morality must give way to
constitutional morality.
• That insofar as Section 377 criminalises consensual sexual acts
of adults (i.e. persons above the age of 18 years who are
competent to consent) in private, is violative of Articles 14, 15, 19,
and 21 of the Constitution.
23
6. Gender Justice : Shah Bano’s Case [(1985) 2 SCC
556] A Milestone in the Journey of Gender Justice
• Petitioner Shah Bano Begum prayed for grant of
maintenance under Section 125 of Cr.P.C.
• The Constitution Bench of the apex Court considering
the provision of Section 125 of the Cr.P.C., opined that the
said provision is truly secular in character and is different
from the personal law of the parties.
• The Court further held that such provisions are
essentially of a prophylactic character and cut across the
barriers of religion.
• The Court also held that the liability imposed by Section
125 to maintain close relatives, who are indigent, is
founded upon the individual's obligation to the society to
prevent vagrancy and destitution.
24
Gender Justice-Preventing Sexual Harassment at
Workplace: Vishaka vs. State of Rajasthan,(1997) 6SCC 241
Bhanwari Devi, a social worker from Rajasthan, was brutally gang-
raped by five men for preventing a child marriage .
• The trial court acquitted all five accused.
• Vishaka, a Group for Women’s Education and Research, took up
the cause of Bhanwari Devi and filed a petition before the
Supreme Court on the issue of sexual harassment at the
workplace.
• On August 13, 1997, the apex Court issued guidelines that
defined sexual harassment and put the onus on the employers as
well as other responsible persons or institutions to provide a safe
working environment for women.
• These guidelines are called ‘Vishaka Guidelines’. These were to be
considered law until appropriate legislation was enacted.
25
Gender Justice: Triple Talaq Unconstitutional
Shayara Bano vs Union Of India And Ors. Vs.
Union of India 22 August, 2017 (5 Judge)
• The Court held by a majority of 3:2 that triple
Talaq is manifestly arbitrary in the sense that
the marital tie can be broken capriciously and
whimsically by a Muslim man without any
attempt at reconciliation so as to save it. This
form of Talaq must, therefore, be held to be
violative of the fundamental right contained
under Article 14 of the Constitution of India.
26
Gender Justice: Entry of Females in
Sabrimala Temple
Indian Young Lawyers Association vs. The State Of Kerala on
28 September, 2018:
• In Sabrimala Temple- a Hindu pilgrimage centre in Kerala,
female devotees between the age group of 10 to 50 years
were denied entry on the basis of certain custom and usage.
• A Constitution bench of the apex Court led by CJI Dipak
Misra overruled the Kerala High Court’s 27-year-old decision
that had upheld the restriction on entry of women into the
temple.
• The court said, “The dualism that persists in religion by
glorifying and venerating women as goddesses on one hand
and by imposing rigorous sanctions on the other hand in
matters of devotion has to be abandoned. Such a dualistic
approach and an entrenched mindset results in indignity to
women and the degradation of their status.” 27
Gender Justice :Sec.497 IPC Unconstitutional
Joseph Shine vs. Union Of India , (2019) 3 SCC 39
• The apex Court struck down Section 497 of IPC
which criminalised adultery holding that it is
violative of Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the
Constitution.
• The Supreme Court called the law unconstitutional
because it “treats a husband as the master”.
• The Court held- “Any provision of law affecting
individual dignity and equality of women invites the
wrath of the Constitution. It’s time to say that the
husband is not the master of the wife. Legal
sovereignty of one sex over other sex is wrong”. 28
7. Constitutional Democracy: Power Under Art.356-
Imposition of President's Rule in States.
• S. R. Bommai v. Union of India , AIR 1994 SC 1918
• In this judgement, the SC attempted to curb the blatant misuse
of Article 356 of the Constitution of India, which allowed
President's rule to be imposed in States.
• The first and most important question which the Supreme Court
had to determine was whether the Presidential Proclamation
under Article 356 was justifiable and if so to what extent.
• Answering the question the apex Court held , the Judicial
Review will involve three questions only:
– Is there any material behind the proclamation.
– Is the material relevant.
– Was there any mala fide use of power.
• The majority enjoyed by the Council of Ministers shall be tested
on the floor of the House. 29
Constitutional Democracy: Election Reforms
Right Not to Vote- NOTA Case
• The S.C. dealing with the issue of election reforms
held that democracy and free elections are part of
the basic structure of the Constitution.
• In a parliamentary democracy A positive ‘right not
to vote’ is a part of voter’s right to expression under
Article 19(1)(a) and it has to be recognized and given
effect to in the same manner as ‘right to vote’.
• The only way by which it can be made effectual is by
providing a button in the EVMs to express that right.
Therefore, the voter must be given an opportunity to
choose none of the above (NOTA) button, which will
indeed compel the political parties to nominate a
sound candidate. 30
Constitutional Democracy: Election
Reforms
Lily Thomas vs Union Of India & Ors., (2013) 7 SCC 653:
• In this case the Supreme Court in a PIL declared sub-
section (4) of Section 8 of the Representation of the
People Act, 1951, which allowed convicted members of
legislative bodies a 3 month time period for appeal against
the conviction and sentencing, as ultra vires the
Constitution.
• The Court ruled that Members of Parliament, Legislative
Councils and Legislative Assemblies convicted of crimes
where they had been awarded a minimum sentence of 2
years imprisonment would cease to be members of the
house to which they were elected from the date of
sentencing. 31
9. Independence Of Judiciary: First Judges Case -
‘in consultation’ – Interpretation
S P Gupta Vs. Union of India And Ors. AIR 1982 SC 149 (First Judges
Case( 1981):
• In this cast the S.C. was called upon to examine as to what does
the word “consultation” in Article 124(2) and in Article 217(1)
of the Constitution actually imply?
• The apex court held by a majority of 4-3 that in the
appointment of a judge of the Supreme Court or the High
Court, the word “consultation” in Article 124(2) and in Article
217(1) of the Constitution does not mean “concurrence”
however the “consultation” with the CJI must be full and
effective.
• The apex Court rejected the idea that the CJI’s opinion should
have primacy. and held that In the event of a disagreement, the
“ultimate power” would rest with the Union Government and
not the CJI.
• 32
Independence Of Judiciary: Second Judges Case-
Birth of Collegium System
• Supreme Court Advocates on Record Association Vs. Union of
India (1993) 4 SCC 441
• This verdict gave birth to the concept of Collegium System.
• A 9 Judges Bench of the apex Court re-examining the view
expressed in the First Judges case by a majority of 7:2 ruled that
Articles 124 and 217 of the Constitution had to be interpreted
in a “purposive and contextual” manner .
• The Court held that there should be a collegium consisting of
Chief Justice and two other senior most judges of the Supreme
Court for making proposal and appointment of judges.
• The apex Court held that in the event of conflict between the
President and the CJI with regard to appointments of Judges, it
was the Chief Justice of India whose opinion would not only have
primacy, but would be determinative in the matter..
33
Independence Of Judiciary: Third Judges Case-
Strengthening of Collegium
• In Re Special Reference Case AIR 1999 SC 1
• This case arose out of a reference made by the
President of India under Article 143 of the Constitution
for advisory opinion of the Supreme Court.
• A nine-Judge bench of the Supreme Court delivered a
unanimous opinion and reaffirmed its verdict
rendered in second Judges case (1993) .
• The only thing that this reference introduced from the
Second Judges case was to increase the number of the
judges in the collegium.
• The collegium was now to consist of the CJI and the
four other senior most judges of the Supreme Court. 34
Independence Of Judiciary: Fourth Judges Case
• Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association v. Union of
India, [(2016) 5 SCC 1] [‘NJAC Case’]
• The Constitution (Ninety-Ninth Amendment) Act, 2014 and the NJAC
Act, 2014 sought to replace the Collegium system with the National
Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC), a body comprising of the CJI,
two senior judges, the Law Minister and “two eminent personalities”
appointed by the Prime Minister, Leader of Opposition and CJI.
• The constitutional validity of the Ninety-Ninth Constitutional
amendment and NJAC Act, 2014, was challenged before the apex Court .
• A constitution bench of five Judges with a majority of 4:1 struck down
the Ninety-Ninth Constitutional Amendment Act and the NJAC Act as
unconstitutional holding that the constitution of the Commission will
amount to an infringement of judicial independence and a violation of
the separation of powers.
35
10. Environmental Protection:
• MC Mehta v. Union of India, AIR 1987 SC 1086 (1986)
• In this case , popularly known as the ‘Oleum gas leak
case’, the Supreme Court disapproved the ‘Strict
Liability’ test enunciated in the English case of Rylands v.
Fletcher for deciding the liability of an enterprise
engaged in a hazardous or inherently dangerous activity
and propounded the principle of ‘Absolute Liability’.
• The Court held that in the case of industries engaged in
hazardous or inherently dangerous activities, absolute
liability was to be followed.
• It also said that the amount of compensation must be
correlated to the magnitude and capacity of the industry
so that it will be a deterrent.
36
11. Social Justice: 50% Threshold in Reservations
and Exclusion of ‘Creamy Layer’.
• Indra Sawhney etc. Vs. Union of India and others, AIR
1993 SC 477 (1992) (9 Judges Bench)
• The apex Court examined the scope of Article 16(4) of
the Constitution, which provides for the reservation of
jobs in favour of backward classes and held that ‘backward
classes’ mentioned in Article 16(4) can be identified only
on the basis of caste and not economic conditions.
• It upheld the constitutional validity of 27% reservation for
the OBCs with certain conditions.
• The propositions of 50% threshold in reservations, the bar
against reservations in certain types of posts and the
exclusion of ‘creamy layer’ were propounded in this case.

caused, they are both guilty of the offence though their acts are separate.
(b) A and B are joint jailors, and as such have the charge of Z, a prisoner, alternatively for six hours at a time. A and B,

jurisdiction.
79. Act done by a person justified, or by mistake of fact believing himself justified, by law.—
Nothing is an offence which is done by any person who is justified by law, or who by reason of a mistake
1. Subs. by Act 8 of 1862, s. 5, for “be less than a”.
2. Subs. by Act 3 of 1910, s. 2, for section 75.

doing it.
Illustration
A sees Z commit what appears to A to be a murder. A, in the exercise, to the best of his judgment exerted in good faith, of
the power which the law gives to all persons of apprehending murderers in the fact, seizes Z, in order to bring Z before the proper
authorities. A has committed no offence, though it may turn out that Z was acting in self-defence.
80. Accident in doing a lawful act.—Nothing is an offence which is done by accident or misfortune,
and without any criminal intention or knowledge in the doing of a lawful act in a lawful manner by lawful
means and with proper care and caution.
Illustration
A is at work with a hatchet; the head flies off and kills a man who is standing by. Here, if there was no want of proper
caution on the part of A, his act is excusable and not an offence.
81. Act likely to cause harm, but done without criminal intent, and to prevent other harm.—
Nothing is an offence merely by reason of its being done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause
harm, if it be done without any criminal intention to cause harm, and in good faith for the purpose of
preventing or avoiding other harm to person or property.
Explanation.—It is a question of fact in such a case whether the harm to be prevented or avoided was
of such a nature and so imminent as to justify or excuse the risk of doing the act with the knowledge that
it was likely to cause harm.
Illustrations
(a) A, the captain of a steam vessel, suddenly and without any fault or negligence on his part, finds himself in such a
position that, before he can stop his vessel, he must inevitably run down a boat B, with twenty or thirty passengers on board,
unless he changes the course of his vessel, and that, by changing his course, he must incur risk of running down a boat C with
only two passengers on board, which he may possibly clear. Here, if A alters his course without any intention to run down the
boat C and in good faith for the purpose of avoiding the danger to the passengers in the boat B, he is not guilty of an offence,
though he may run down the boat C by doing an act which he knew was likely to cause that effect, if it be found as a matter of
fact that the danger which he intended to avoid was such as to excuse him in incurring the risk of running down C.
(b) A, in a great fire, pulls down houses in order to prevent the conflagration from spreading. He does this with the intention
in good faith of saving human life or property. Here, if it be found that the harm to be prevented was of such a nature and so
imminent as to excuse A's act, A is not guilty of the offence.

seven years of age.
83. Act of a child above seven and under twelve of immature understanding.—Nothing is an
offence which is done by a child above seven years of age and under twelve, who has not attained
sufficient maturity of understanding to judge of the nature and consequences of his conduct on that
occasion.
84. Act of a person of unsound mind.—Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the
time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that
he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law.
85. Act of a person incapable of judgment by reason of intoxication caused against his will.—
Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, is, by reason of intoxication,
incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is either wrong, or contrary to
law; provided that the thing which intoxicated him was administered to him without his knowledge or
against his will.
86. Offence requiring a particular intent or knowledge committed by one who is intoxicated.—
In cases where an act done is not an offence unless done with a particular knowledge or intent, a person
who does the act in a state of intoxication shall be liable to be dealt with as if he had the same knowledge
as he would have had if he had not been intoxicated, unless the thing which intoxicated him was
administered to him without his knowledge or against his will.
87. Act not intended and not known to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt, done by
consent.—Nothing which is not intended to cause death, or grievous hurt, and which is not known by the
doer to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause,
26
or be intended by the doer to cause, to any person, above eighteen years of age, who has given consent,
whether express or implied, to suffer that harm; or by reason of any harm which it may be known by the
doer to be likely to cause to any such person who has consented to take the risk of that harm.
Illustration
A and Z agree to fence with each other for amusement. This agreement implies the consent of each to suffer any harm which
in the course of such fencing, may be caused without foul play; and if A, while playing fairly, hurts Z, A commits no offence.
88. Act not intended to cause death, done by consent in good faith for person's benefit.—
Nothing, which is not intented to cause death, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or
be intended by the doer to cause, or be known by the doer to be likely to cause, to any person for whose
benefit it is done in good faith, and who has given a consent, whether express or implied, to suffer that
harm, or to take the risk of that harm.
Illustration
A, a surgeon, knowing that a particular operation is likely to cause the death of Z, who suffers under the painful complaint,
but not intending to cause Z's death, and intending, in good faith, Z's benefit, performs
