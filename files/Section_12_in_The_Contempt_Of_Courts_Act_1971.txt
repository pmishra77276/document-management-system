Section 12 in The Contempt Of Courts Act, 1971

12. Punishment for contempt of court.—

(1)Save as otherwise expressly provided in this Act or in any other law, a contempt of court may be
punished with simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months, or with fine which
may extend to two thousand rupees, or with both:Provided that the accused may be discharged or
the punishment awarded may be remitted on apology being made to the satisfaction of the
court.Explanation.—An apology shall not be rejected merely on the ground that it is qualified or
conditional if the accused makes it bona fide.(2)Notwithstanding anything contained in any other
law for the time being in force, no court shall impose a sentence in excess of that specified in
sub-section (1) for any contempt either in respect of itself or of a court subordinate to
it.(3)Notwithstanding anything contained in this section, where a person is found guilty of a civil
contempt, the court, if it considers that a fine will not meet the ends of justice and that a sentence of
imprisonment is necessary shall, instead of sentencing him to simple imprisonment, direct that he
be detained in a civil prison for such period not exceeding six months as it may think fit.(4)Where
the person found guilty of contempt of court in respect of any undertaking given to a court is a
company, every person who, at the time the contempt was committed, was in charge of, and was
responsible to, the company for the conduct of business of the company, as well as the company,
shall be deemed to be guilty of the contempt and the punishment may be enforced, with the leave of
the court, by the detention in civil prison of each such person:Provided that nothing contained in
this sub-section shall render any such person liable to such punishment if he proves that the
contempt was committed without his knowledge or that he exercised all due diligence to prevent its
commission.(5)Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (4), where the contempt of court
referred to therein has been committed by a company and it is proved that the contempt has been
committed with the consent or connivance of, or is attributable to any neglect on the part of, any
director, manager, secretary or other officer of the company, such director, manager, secretary or
other officer shall also be deemed to be guilty of the contempt and the punishment may be enforced,
with the leave of the court, by the detention in civil prison of such director, manager, secretary or
other officer.Explanation.—For the purposes of sub-sections (4) and (5),—(a)“company” means any
body corporate and includes a firm or other association of individuals; and(b)“director”, in relation
to a firm, means a partner in the firm.
