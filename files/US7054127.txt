ABSTRACT
A cable device includes an integrated Surge protection
circuit. In the event that, communication signals conveyed
by the cable include (potentially damaging) transient Volt
ages, the Surge protection circuit integrated in the cable
Suppresses the transient Voltages at a distance from a cor
responding electronic circuit to which the cable is attached.
Consequently, potentially damaging Voltage transients

imparted on the communication signals are clamped before

reaching potentially sensitive inputs of the electronic circuit.
