Gratuity & Ex - Gratia Rules 
 

1. Purpose: To establish guidelines for managing company gratuity and ex-gratia pay practices for the employees. 



2. Scope: To all level employees.  

3.Definitions:  

3.1 Gratuity is the monetary amount which is payable to the employee of an organization under the Payment of  
Gratuity Act 1972. This is mainly paid to the employee as a token of appreciation for his/her continued services  
towards the company for not less than five years.  

3.2 Employee means both on roll and contractual workman  

4. Eligible Employees to avail this benefit after resignation, retirement or Death:  

4.1 In case of resignation and retirement /superannuation  

4.1.1 Gratuity is payable to employee within 30 days if an Employee completes 5 years or 4 years + 240 working  
days in 5th year with single employer. There should not be any service gap in this period or change in employer.  
Employer can be either -- or any Manpower Contractor.   

4.1.2 However, in case if any employee is transferred from the rolls of one manpower contractor to other or from  
rolls of one manpower contractor to -- roll without a service gap of single day. -- as a gesture and a token of  
appreciation for continued service of the employee and as part of its welfare package will pay a one time "ex 
gratia" amount to its employees post resgination. This amount will be calculated on same formulae as prescribed  
for gratuity and as mentioned below.  

For ease of understanding few examples are mentioned below:-  

Suppose if Mr. X is an Employee and Y and Z are manpower contractor organizations, then Example 1:- If 

X is transferred from rolls of Y to rolls of Z (OR) he is transferred from rolls of either Y or Z  to -- roll, then 

his Service tenure will be considered from date of joining with his joining on rolls of  Manpower 

Contractor "Y" as that was his first date of joining) and amount will be paid as ex-gratia for  employees as 

welfare from -- as mentioned above in 4.1.2.  

Example 2- Mr. X joined on rolls of Contractor Y and then left due to any reason, and later he joins rolls of  
contractor Z or -- rolls. Then, Mr. X will not be eligible for "ex-gratia" as it is not continued service and  
there is a service gap.  

4.2 In case of death or Permanent disablement  

Gratuity will be paid as per actual service tenure till death date in his/her nominee's account within 30 days from  
the date of death. Meaning that in case of death or permanent diability, this threshhold of 5 years is not applicable  
and gratuity will be paid to the nominee of the employee even if he/she has not completed 5 years of service with 
an  organization either through contr or directly, whichever is the case. Gratuity will be paid to nominee as per 
available  records/nomination forms filled by employee at the time of joining.  

5. Gratuity Calculation  

Gratuity Formula= (Last drawn Basic + VDA)*15/26 * No. of years of service  

For example, if an employee has been working for a company for 10 years and the last drawn basic+VDA salary is  
INR 20000, then the gratuity amount will be:  



Gratuity Amount = 20000/26 x15 x 10 = INR 1,15,385  
* Post completion of 5 years of service, to calculate the number of years for computing gratuity or ex gratia  

(whicever the case may be), anything above 6 months is rounded off to the next number and anything  

below 6 months will be rounded off to the previous number. For example, if you have worked at an 

organization for 8 years and 7 months, then the number of years will be calculated as 9 years whereas if an  

employee has worked for a company for 8 years and 4 months, then it will be considered as 8 years only. 6. 

Forfeiture of Gratuity  

Notwithstanding the foregoing  

6.1 the gratuity or ex-gratia (whichever the case may be) of an employee whose services have been terminated for  
any act, wilful omission or negligence causing any damage or loss to, or destruction of, property belonging to the  
employer shall be forfeited to the extent of the damage or loss so caused.  

6.2 the gratuity or ex-gratia (whichever the case may be) payable to an employeemay be wholly or partially  
forfeited:-  

(a) if the services of such employee have been terminated for his riotous or disorderly conduct or any other  
act of violence on his part, or  

(b) if the services of such employee have been terminated for any act which constitutes an offence 
involving  moral turpitude.
