      "The Respondent is contesting the Claimant's claim for funding of USD 62 million, arguing that it was not sought in the initial Statement of Claim and was only introduced as a last-minute addition to circumvent the Respondent's objections. The Respondent cites several precedents to support their position that the Claimant's plea of Quantum Meruit is not sustainable, as it seeks to double-compensate itself for the same contract and violates the principle that a party cannot claim damages under Quantum Meruit if they are seeking specific performance of a contract.\n",

      "\n",
      "In the context of the arbitration proceedings, the claimants' plea for Quantum Meruit compensation is being challenged by the respondent, with the learned counsel arguing that the rigors of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC) do not apply to arbitration proceedings. The court has recognized the principles of Quantum Meruit under Section 70 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and has ruled that the claimants are not entitled to receive any amount from the respondent, as the value of the benefit received does not equate to the value of the alleged loss suffered.\n",

      "In cases where a contractual relationship does not exist between the parties, such as in Section 70 of the Contract Act, the law applies a concept of quasi-contract or restitution, where an obligation is based on a third category of law rather than a contract or tort. This is illustrated in cases like Mulamchand vs. State of Madhya Pradesh and has been upheld in subsequent judgments, and is relevant to the matter at hand where a contractual relationship exists between the parties.\n",

This type of obligation is distinct from traditional contractual relationships and is recognized by the Supreme Court in cases such as Mulamchand vs. State of Madhya Pradesh, which has been upheld in subsequent judgments.\n",
